# Signal Matrix Platform — Project Context

## What This Project Is
Signal Matrix is a multi-timeframe, probabilistic trading signal platform designed to identify
high-conviction trade opportunities across a diversified universe of ~51 assets. Built on fractal
market theory, wave structure analysis, and probabilistic statistics — not traditional lagging
indicators.

## Core Philosophy
- Fewer, higher quality signals beat more, lower quality signals
- Trend alignment across timeframes is the primary filter
- Risk ranges are mathematically derived, not discretionary
- The system tells you where the market is, not where you want it to be

---

## Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Create React App)
- **Container:** Docker + docker-compose
- **Data:** Real EOD prices via Yahoo Finance — FastAPI backend with SQLite cache
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI running at localhost:8000
- **Database:** SQLite cache at `backend/signal_matrix.db`
- **yfinance:** v1.2.0 — do not downgrade (v0.2.x has persistent 429 block)
- **Dev environment:** Windows PC, Docker Desktop, VS Code, localhost:3000
- **Hot reload:** `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true` in docker-compose.yml
- **Claude Code:** `autoVerify: true` — verifies at localhost:3000 after every change
- **Claude in Chrome extension:** enabled and operational. Set to allow access to all sites including localhost:3000. When "started debugging this browser" banner appears in Chrome, do not click Cancel — leave it open so the debugger can attach and complete screenshot/page verification.
- **Yahoo Finance:** Manual REFRESH DATA button only — never auto-fetch on page load
- **Git:** No worktrees or feature branches — all changes committed directly to master
- **Version control:** Git initialized, first commit `42e6663` — "Phase 1 complete - Tasks 1-5"

---

## Known Fixes & Learnings

Critical issues already resolved — do not reintroduce these bugs:

### yfinance 1.2.0 — Do Not Downgrade
- v0.2.x had a persistent 429 block that could not be resolved by waiting
- v1.2.0 resolved it immediately — always use v1.2.0 or higher in `requirements.txt`

### tz-aware Date Comparison (`yahoo_finance.py`)
- yfinance 1.2.0 returns timezone-aware timestamps
- Old comparison `closes.index < pd.Timestamp(date.today())` crashes with tz-aware index
- **Fixed:** `closes.index.date < date.today()` — always use this pattern

### Stale Cache Fallback on 429 (`market_data.py`)
- Old behavior: batch endpoint returned empty on 429 — dashboard went blank
- **Fixed:** On 429, batch endpoint now serves whatever is cached in SQLite
- All 48 tickers stay visible even during rate limit windows

### `updated_at` Refreshes on Upsert (`market_data.py`)
- Old behavior: `updated_at` only stamped original insert date — never updated
- **Fixed:** Added `existing.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()` to upsert path
- Stamps actual fetch time on every successful refresh

### `updated_at` Format Consistent (`market_data.py`)
- **Fixed:** `row.updated_at.strftime("%m/%d/%y %H:%M")` — matches frontend expectation
- Do not use `str(row.updated_at)` — format mismatch breaks timestamp display

### EOD Timestamp Dynamic in Header (`App.js`)
- Old behavior: "EOD · 03/11/26" was hardcoded in JSX
- **Fixed:** Now reads from first ticker's `updated` field in `realDataMap`
- Never hardcode dates in JSX

### Cache Date Reset Pattern
- When `history_json` is NULL on existing rows (schema migration artifact), cache_date guard prevents re-fetch
- **Fix:** Reset all rows to `cache_date = '1970-01-01'` to force fresh fetch
- SQL: `UPDATE price_cache SET cache_date = '1970-01-01'`

## Phase 1 — COMPLETE ✅
## Phase 2 — COMPLETE ✅
## Phase 3 — IN PROGRESS 🔄

### Phase 3 Build Sequence

| Task | Deliverable | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Hurst + Fractal Dimension (DFA) | `backend/services/signal_engine.py` | ✅ Complete |
| 3.2 | ABC Pivot Detector | `backend/services/pivot_engine.py` | ✅ Complete |
| 3.3 | LRR/HRR + Conviction Engine | `backend/services/conviction_engine.py` | ⬜ Next |
| 3.4 | Wire to Dashboard | React frontend (App.js) | ⬜ Pending 3.3 |

### New Button — CALCULATE SIGNALS
- Added to dashboard header alongside REFRESH DATA
- Manual trigger only — never auto-calculates on page load
- Must be run AFTER REFRESH DATA (price history must be current)
- Calls: `/api/signals/hurst` → `/api/signals/pivots` → `/api/signals/output` in sequence
- Signal engine reads from `price_cache` SQLite table — NEVER calls yfinance directly

---

## Signal Engine Math — Phase 3 (ALL DECISIONS LOCKED)

### Hurst Exponent (H)
- **Method: DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)**
- **Lookback windows:**
  - Trade: 63 trading days
  - Trend: 252 trading days
  - Long Term: 756 trading days
- **Minimum bars required:** same as lookback — return null if insufficient, do not skip ticker
- **D = 2 − H** (Fractal Dimension derived directly from H)

### DFA Algorithm
```python
def dfa(prices, window):
    # 1. Convert prices to log returns
    # 2. Compute cumulative sum (integration)
    # 3. Scales: log-spaced from 10 bars to window//4, ~20 points
    # 4. For each scale n: fit linear trend per segment, compute RMS of residuals F(n)
    # 5. H = slope of log(F(n)) vs log(n) via linear regression
    # Returns H in [0, 1]
    # H > 0.5 = trending, H < 0.5 = mean-reverting, H = 0.5 = random walk
```

### Conviction Score Formula
```
Base Score = weighted average:
  Trade H (DFA, 63-day)   → 55%   primary signal
  Trend H (DFA, 252-day)  → 25%   alignment filter
  Rel IV% inverted        → 20%   IV Score = (100 - RelIV%) / 100

Volume Multiplier (applied after base score):
  Confirming  → × 1.15
  Neutral     → × 1.00
  Diverging   → × 0.80

Final Conviction = Base Score × Volume Multiplier

CRITICAL: Conviction is BLANK (not calculated) when Viewpoint = Neutral
```

**Long Term H (756-day):** calculated and stored, displayed in popup as context only.
Not used in conviction formula.

### Direction Determination — Pivots Only (H has NO role)

**H does not determine direction. H drives conviction and LRR position only.**

```python
# Uptrend validity — price must be above higher of LRR or C
effective_floor = max(lrr, c)
if price > effective_floor:
    trade_dir = "Bullish"
else:
    trade_dir = "Neutral"

# Downtrend validity — price must be below lower of HRR or C
effective_ceiling = min(hrr, c)
if price < effective_ceiling:
    trade_dir = "Bearish"
else:
    trade_dir = "Neutral"

# Viewpoint — three states only
if trade_dir == "Bullish" and trend_dir == "Bullish":
    viewpoint = "Bullish"
elif trade_dir == "Bearish" and trend_dir == "Bearish":
    viewpoint = "Bearish"
else:
    viewpoint = "Neutral"
```

| Condition | Direction |
|---|---|
| Price above MAX(LRR, C) — valid uptrend | Bullish |
| Price below MIN(HRR, C) — valid downtrend | Bearish |
| Break of Trade (price closes through C) | Neutral |
| FORMING — no new C confirmed yet | Neutral |
| Insufficient pivot history | Neutral |
| Everything else | Neutral |

### LRR / HRR Display — Always Show

LRR and HRR always calculate and always display regardless of viewpoint.
Color communicates the state:
- Bullish viewpoint → green
- Bearish viewpoint → red
- Neutral viewpoint → grey (`#8899aa`)

### Viewpoint States — FINAL (LOCKED)

| Viewpoint | Condition | Conviction |
|---|---|---|
| **Bullish** | Trade Bullish + Trend Bullish | Calculated normally |
| **Bearish** | Trade Bearish + Trend Bearish | Calculated normally |
| **Neutral** | Any other combination — including one Neutral, one Bullish/Bearish, or opposite directions | BLANK |

**No Diverging state.** Three states only: Bullish, Bearish, Neutral.

### Alert Flag ⚡ Trigger (ALL THREE must be true)
1. Trade H > 0.55 AND Trend H > 0.55
2. Viewpoint = Bullish OR Bearish (never fires on Neutral)
3. Final Conviction ≥ 70%

### The Four Trading Scenarios

**Scenario 1 — Bearish Trend + Bearish Trade (Aligned Short)**
- Viewpoint = Bearish
- Add to short: price near or at HRR (entry zone on bounce)
- Remove short: Trade or Trend breaks (price closes above C)

**Scenario 2 — Bearish Trend, Trade Turning**
- Viewpoint = Neutral
- Trade breaks upward: higher low C forms, price closes above B on trade timeframe
- Either continues (→ Scenario 3) or Trade fails and breaks back below new C

**Scenario 3 — Bullish Trend + Bullish Trade (Aligned Long)**
- Viewpoint = Bullish
- Add to long: price near or at LRR
- Lighten long: price approaching HRR
- Remove long: Trade or Trend breaks (price closes below C)

**Scenario 4 — Bullish Trend, Trade Breaking Down**
- Viewpoint = Neutral (Trade broken, Trend still Bullish)
- Trade Dir flips to Neutral immediately on close below C
- LRR/HRR still show — displayed grey
- Watch for Trend break (price closes below Trend C)

### ABC Pivot Structure

**Uptrend:**
```
A = pivot low   (e.g. $100)
B = pivot high  (e.g. $110)  — higher high
C = higher low  (e.g. $105)  — C > A confirms uptrend
D = running high             — established when price closes above B
```

**Downtrend (mirror):**
```
A = pivot high  (e.g. $100)
B = pivot low   (e.g. $90)   — lower low
C = lower high  (e.g. $95)   — C < A confirms downtrend
D = running low              — established when price closes below B
```

**Pivot detection bar windows:**
- Trade: **5 bars** (before AND after — both sides required)
- Trend: 20 bars (before AND after — both sides required)
- Long Term: 90 bars (before AND after — both sides required)

**CRITICAL — Pivot confirmation requires bar_window bars on BOTH sides:**
```python
# Pivot high at index i:
prices[i] == max(prices[i - bar_window : i + bar_window + 1])

# Pivot low at index i:
prices[i] == min(prices[i - bar_window : i + bar_window + 1])

# NEVER confirm a pivot without full bar_window on both sides
# This means the most recent bar_window bars can never be confirmed pivots
# D is always a running value — never a confirmed pivot
```

**CRITICAL — Today's bar must be excluded:**
```python
# Strip incomplete bars before running pivot detection
today = pd.Timestamp(date.today())
prices = prices[prices.index < today]
```

### C Update Logic — CRITICAL

**C is NOT set once and frozen. C updates dynamically as the trend develops.**

```python
# After initial C is confirmed, on every calculation run:

# UPTREND — C walks UP (higher lows)
new_pivot_low = find_most_recent_confirmed_pivot_low(prices, bar_window)
if new_pivot_low > current_C:
    current_C = new_pivot_low  # Update to higher low

# DOWNTREND — C walks DOWN (lower highs)
new_pivot_high = find_most_recent_confirmed_pivot_high(prices, bar_window)
if new_pivot_high < current_C:
    current_C = new_pivot_high  # Update to lower high

# Break of trade always uses CURRENT C — never stale C
if direction == UPTREND and current_price < current_C:
    state = BREAK_OF_TRADE

if direction == DOWNTREND and current_price > current_C:
    state = BREAK_OF_TRADE
```

**Why this matters:** A stale C means LRR is anchored to an old pivot, break levels are wrong,
and conviction is understated. C must always reflect the most recent confirmed higher low
(uptrend) or lower high (downtrend).

**Example — GLD trade timeframe:**
```
Initial C = $427.13  Feb 2    (first confirmed higher low)
Updated C = $448.20  Feb 17   (new higher low — C walks up)
Break of trade = price closes below $448.20 (current C)
NOT $427.13 (stale C)
```

### LRR / HRR — Naming Convention
- **LRR = always the lower price value**
- **HRR = always the higher price value**

**Uptrend:** Enter at LRR, target HRR (above D)
**Downtrend:** Enter at HRR (bounce), target LRR (below D)

### LRR Formula — Uptrend
```
Base LRR = C + (B − C) × H_factor

H_factor lookup:
  H > 0.65        →  0.95  (near B — strong trend)
  H 0.55 – 0.65   →  0.50  (midpoint — moderate trend)
  H 0.50 – 0.55   →  0.05  (near C — weak trend)
  H < 0.50        →  0.00  (default to C — LRR shows grey, no valid H signal)
```

LRR always calculates and always displays. H < 0.50 defaults LRR to C, shown in grey.

### HRR Formula — Uptrend
```
Base HRR = D + (1σ of recent returns)

HRR vs prior D interpretation:
  HRR well above prior D → full conviction, full size
  HRR near prior D       → moderate conviction, reduced size
  HRR below prior D      → caution confirmed, minimum size
```

### Downtrend Mirror Formulas
```
Base HRR = C − (C − B) × H_factor   ← entry on bounce (higher price)
Base LRR = D − (1σ of recent returns) ← profit target (lower price)
```

### Rel IV Scaling (ATR Equivalent)
IV scales LRR/HRR width — behaves like ATR expanding and contracting with volatility.

| Rel IV% | LRR Adj (Uptrend) | HRR Adj (Uptrend) |
|---|---|---|
| 0–30% | × 0.99 (tight) | × 1.02 |
| 31–60% | × 1.00 (neutral) | × 1.05 |
| 61–80% | × 0.97 (wider) | × 1.10 |
| > 80% | × 0.94 (max) | × 1.15 |

Downtrend: HRR pushed up, LRR pulled down (same widening logic, mirrored).

### Structural States

| State | Uptrend Condition | Downtrend Condition | Display |
|---|---|---|---|
| UPTREND_VALID / DOWNTREND_VALID | C > A, price above MAX(LRR, C) | C < A, price below MIN(HRR, C) | Normal green/red |
| FORMING | Pullback from D, no new C yet | Bounce from D, no new C yet | LRR/HRR update, grey |
| EXTENDED | Price above D, new C not formed | Price below D, new C not formed | LRR/HRR shown, grey |
| WARNING | LRR drifted below C (IV-driven only) | HRR drifted above C (IV-driven only) | LRR or HRR cell → amber |
| BREAK_OF_TRADE | Price closes below C (trade tf) | Price closes above C (trade tf) | Trade Dir → Neutral, LRR/HRR grey |
| BREAK_OF_TREND | Price closes below C (trend tf) | Price closes above C (trend tf) | Trend Dir → Neutral, Trend LRR grey |
| NO_STRUCTURE | Insufficient pivot history | Insufficient pivot history | LRR/HRR grey |

**Critical rules:**
- **C is the line in the sand** — Break of Trade/Trend fires on price closing through C
- **Break of Trade = Trade Dir → Neutral immediately** — no intermediate state
- **WARNING state is IV-driven only** — never price-driven
- **LRR/HRR always show** — color reflects state (green/red/grey)
- **Effective floor (uptrend) = MAX(LRR, C)** — Bullish only when price above this
- **Effective ceiling (downtrend) = MIN(HRR, C)** — Bearish only when price below this
- **Direction determined by pivots only** — H has no role
- **Trade and Trend states are independent** — Trend break does not auto-flip Trade
- **C updates dynamically** — always references most recent confirmed higher low / lower high

### New Database Tables (Phase 3)
```sql
signal_hurst:   ticker, h_trade, h_trend, h_lt, d_trade, d_trend, d_lt, calculated_at
                UNIQUE(ticker)

signal_pivots:  ticker, timeframe, bar_window,
                pivot_a, pivot_b, pivot_c, pivot_d,
                pivot_a_date, pivot_b_date, pivot_c_date, pivot_d_date,
                structural_state, calculated_at
                UNIQUE(ticker, timeframe)

signal_output:  ticker, timeframe, lrr, hrr, structural_state,
                conviction, trade_direction, h_value, calculated_at
                UNIQUE(ticker, timeframe)
```

### New FastAPI Endpoints (Phase 3)
```
GET /api/signals/hurst    ← Task 3.1 ✅
GET /api/signals/pivots   ← Task 3.2 ✅
GET /api/signals/output   ← Task 3.3
```

### Sanity Checks
| Ticker | Expected H(Trade) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| SPY | 0.50–0.65 | Broad market — moderate trend |
| GLD | 0.60–0.75 | Strong persistent trend |
| VIX | 0.30–0.45 | Mean-reverting by nature |
| TLT | 0.45–0.60 | Range-bound recently |

## Data Layer

### Rules
- Signal engine NEVER calls yfinance directly — always reads from `price_cache` table
- REFRESH DATA populates the cache — CALCULATE SIGNALS reads from it
- Same-day cache invalidation — stale rows reset before re-fetch
- Price history excludes today's incomplete bar before pivot detection

### tickers.js — Tier 1 (48 tickers, STATIC)
Do not modify without explicit instruction. Source of truth for ticker universe.

## Methodology Reference

### Timeframes
- **Trade** — ≤ 3 weeks — entry/exit timing
- **Trend** — ≤ 3 months — directional bias filter
- **Long Term** — 3 years — macro structural context (display/context only)

### Signal Components
1. **Fractal Dimension (D)** — D→1.0 trending, D→1.5 choppy, D→2.0 mean-reverting. D = 2 − H
2. **Hurst Exponent (H)** — H>0.5 trending, H<0.5 mean-reverting, H=0.5 random walk. Method: DFA
3. **Gaussian Component** — normal distribution of returns, foundation for HRR (1σ above/below D)
4. **Relative IV** — IV as percentile of its own 52-week range. Stock-specific, not vs VIX.
   Primary role: LRR/HRR width scaling (ATR equivalent). Secondary: conviction score component.
5. **Volume Signal** — Confirming / Diverging / Neutral. Applied as multiplier to conviction score.

### Direction Values (ALL three timeframes)
- **Bullish** / **Bearish** / **Neutral** — never Up / Down

---

## Statistical Framework

| Component | Paradigm | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Hurst Exponent | **Frequentist** | Objective measurement of price series property |
| Fractal Dimension | **Frequentist** | Derived from H: D = 2 − H |
| Gaussian Return Distribution | **Frequentist** | Historical return frequency → confidence intervals |
| Relative IV Percentile | **Frequentist** | Rank within own 52-week historical distribution |
| Conviction Score | **Frequentist** | Signal profile historically hit HRR frequency |
| LRR / HRR Ranges | **Frequentist** | Anchored to Gaussian sigma bands and pivot points |
| Quad Probability Distribution | **Bayesian** | Continuously updated belief across 4 quads |
| Forward Quarter Projections Q2-Q4 | **Bayesian** | Prior decay without new confirming evidence |
| Policy Signal Modifiers | **Bayesian** | Discrete evidence updates to forward projections |

---

## Project Rules — Read Before Making Changes
1. **Never modify the ticker universe without explicit instruction**
2. **Never hardcode passwords, API keys, or secrets** — always use `.env`
3. **Never hard delete tickers** — use `active: false`
4. **Direction values are Bullish / Bearish / Neutral** — never Up / Down
5. **HRR = Higher Risk Range** — always the higher price value — do not rename
6. **LRR = Lower Risk Range** — always the lower price value — do not rename
7. **Neutral color is `#8899aa` grey** — amber `#f0b429` is for alerts and WARNING state cells only
8. **Asset Class values must exactly match:** Domestic Equities | Domestic Fixed Income | Digital Assets | Foreign Exchange | International Equities | Commodities
9. **Keep components modular** — one component per file
10. **Docker:** changes to `src/` reflect on save — no rebuild needed for frontend
11. **Do not modify** `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, or `package.json` without flagging first
12. **Phase 3 signal calculations are now in scope** — implement per spec above, no deviations
13. **Flag all [OPEN] items** before implementing — do not assume defaults
14. **Commit to Git** after every confirmed working state
15. **Neo = Claude Code** (VS Code extension) — all code changes go here
16. **No worktrees or feature branches** — all changes committed directly to master

18. **Never auto-calculate signals** — CALCULATE SIGNALS button only
19. **`backend/signal_matrix.db` must never be committed to Git**
20. **C is the invalidation level** — Break of Trade/Trend fires on price closing through C
21. **Signal engine never calls yfinance directly** — always reads from price_cache table
22. **Pivot confirmation requires bar_window bars on BOTH sides** — before AND after

24. **C updates dynamically** — never stale, always most recent confirmed higher low / lower high
25. **Conviction is blank when Viewpoint = Neutral**
26. **Direction determined by pivots only** — H has no role in direction or viewpoint
27. **LRR/HRR always show** — grey when Neutral, green when Bullish, red when Bearish
28. **Viewpoint has three states only** — Bullish, Bearish, Neutral (no Diverging)
29. **Effective floor (uptrend) = MAX(LRR, C)** — Bullish only when price above this
30. **Effective ceiling (downtrend) = MIN(HRR, C)** — Bearish only when price below this
