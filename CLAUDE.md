# Signal Matrix Platform — Project Context

## Read order (authoritative)
1. CLAUDE.md (this file) — current rules, constraints, and state. Authoritative.
2. Before ANY methodology or architecture change → read DECISIONS.md (the "why" / regression guards; ADR-lite).
3. Before touching a superseded component → check the Docs/ archive.

Document maintenance is governed by `Docs/CLAUDE_md_Maintenance_Protocol.md`. To record a change, the trigger is **"Log this change."**

## Important Note for Neo
The `.docx` spec files in `Docs/` cannot be read by Claude Code.
Readable `.txt` copies exist:
- `Docs/SignalMatrix_Spec_v1.7.txt` — **current** full platform spec (v1.7 — BB LRR/HRR framework, Trend/Tail Levels, proximity conviction, ENTRY prox threshold, EXTENDED redesign)
- `Docs/SignalMatrix_Spec_v1.6.txt` — **superseded** by v1.7 (Phases 1–5 complete, OBV, VIX gauge, futures — retained for reference)
- `Docs/SignalMatrix_Spec_v1.5.txt` — prior version (Phase 4 era — superseded by v1.6)
- `Docs/SignalMatrix_Phase5_Spec_v1.0.txt` — Phase 5 spec (Supabase, Fly.io, Schwab OAuth, IV)
- `Docs/SignalMatrix_ConvictionEngine_v1_9_Spec.md` — v1.9 spec (Quad Multiplier, VIX gate, 5-layer conviction formula) ✅ Superseded by v2.0
- `Docs/SignalMatrix_ConvictionEngine_v2_0_Spec.md` — v2.0 spec (Additive formula, 4 components, display threshold 45, alert threshold 80) ✅ Implemented
Neo should read the relevant spec before making methodology or architecture changes.
CLAUDE.md remains the authoritative source for rules and current state.

## What This Project Is
Signal Matrix is a multi-timeframe, probabilistic trading signal platform designed to identify
high-conviction trade opportunities across a diversified universe of ~51 assets. Built on fractal
market theory, wave structure analysis, and probabilistic statistics — not traditional lagging
indicators.

## Core Philosophy
- Fewer, higher quality signals beat more, lower quality signals
- Trend alignment across timeframes is the primary filter
- Risk ranges are mathematically derived, not discretionary
- The system tells you where the market is, not where you want it to be

## Known Fixes & Learnings

Critical issues already resolved — do not reintroduce these bugs:

### yfinance 1.2.0 — Do Not Downgrade
- v0.2.x had a persistent 429 block that could not be resolved by waiting
- v1.2.0 resolved it immediately — always use v1.2.0 or higher in `requirements.txt`

### tz-aware Date Comparison (`yahoo_finance.py`)
- yfinance 1.2.0 returns timezone-aware timestamps
- Old comparison `closes.index < pd.Timestamp(date.today())` crashes with tz-aware index
- **Fixed:** `closes.index.date <= date.today()` — use `.date` attribute for comparison; use `<=` (not `<`) to include today's confirmed EOD close (see EOD Bar Inclusion Fix below)

### Stale Cache Fallback on 429 (`market_data.py`)
- Old behavior: batch endpoint returned empty on 429 — dashboard went blank
- **Fixed:** On 429, batch endpoint now serves whatever is cached in SQLite
- All active tickers stay visible even during rate limit windows

### `updated_at` Refreshes on Upsert (`market_data.py`)
- Old behavior: `updated_at` only stamped original insert date — never updated
- **Fixed:** Added `existing.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()` to upsert path
- Stamps actual fetch time on every successful refresh

### `updated_at` Format and Timezone (`market_data.py`)
- `updated_at` is stored as UTC naive datetime via `datetime.utcnow()`
- Old display: `row.updated_at.strftime(...)` — formatted UTC directly, showed wrong date after 8 PM ET
- **Fixed:** `row.updated_at.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).astimezone(_ET).strftime("%m/%d/%y %H:%M")` in `serialize_cache_row`
- Do not use `str(row.updated_at)` — format mismatch breaks timestamp display
- Do not call `datetime.now(_ET)` at write time — store UTC, convert at display

### EOD Timestamp Dynamic in Header (`App.js`)
- Old behavior: "EOD · 03/11/26" was hardcoded in JSX
- **Fixed:** Now reads from first ticker's `updated` field in `realDataMap`
- Never hardcode dates in JSX

### `updated` Timestamp Uses ET in `yahoo_finance.py`
- Old behavior: `datetime.now()` in Docker returns UTC — after 8 PM ET the date flips to the next day
- **Fixed:** `datetime.now(_ET).strftime("%m/%d/%y %H:%M")` — always stamps ET time
- `_ET = ZoneInfo("America/New_York")` declared at module level in `yahoo_finance.py`

### Cache Date Reset Pattern
- When `history_json` is NULL on existing rows (schema migration artifact), cache_date guard prevents re-fetch
- **Fix:** Reset all rows to `cache_date = '1970-01-01'` to force fresh fetch
- SQL: `UPDATE price_cache SET cache_date = '1970-01-01'`

### UTC vs ET Date in Docker — CRITICAL (Task 4.2)
- Docker containers run UTC. `date.today()` and `datetime.utcnow().date()` return UTC date.
- After ~8 PM ET (midnight UTC), UTC date flips to the next day while ET date has not.
- **Three places this causes bugs:**
  1. `cache_date` in `price_cache` — stored as UTC, checked as UTC → cache miss after 8 PM ET
  2. `run_date` in `scheduler_log` — stored as UTC, checked as UTC → `today_complete` returns false
  3. NYSE trading day check — should always use ET date (NYSE operates on ET)
- **Fix:** Use ET date everywhere. Pattern:
  ```python
  from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
  from datetime import datetime
  _ET = ZoneInfo("America/New_York")
  today_et = datetime.now(_ET).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")   # for string storage
  today_et = datetime.now(_ET).date()                  # for date object
  ```
- **Files fixed:** `backend/routers/market_data.py`, `backend/services/scheduler.py`, `backend/routers/scheduler.py`
- **Do not use** `date.today()`, `str(date.today())`, or `datetime.utcnow().date()` for any date that represents a trading day or cache key

### FORMING State Removed — EXTENDED Removed from structural_state (`pivot_engine.py`, `conviction_engine.py`) — v1.7 / post-v1.7
- **FORMING eliminated:** "Pullback from D, no new C yet" is now simply `UPTREND_VALID` / `DOWNTREND_VALID` — the trend is confirmed, the pullback is normal operation, no special state needed
- **EXTENDED removed from `structural_state`** — EXTENDED is now a dedicated boolean field `d_extended` in `signal_pivots` and `signal_output`. `structural_state` never contains "EXTENDED". The five valid `structural_state` values are: `UPTREND_VALID`, `DOWNTREND_VALID`, `BREAK_OF_TRADE`, `BREAK_OF_TREND`, `BREAK_CONFIRMED`, `NO_STRUCTURE` — nothing else.
- **WARNING removed from `structural_state`** — WARNING was a conviction-engine concept that conflicted with pivot-engine states (e.g. both BREAK_OF_TRADE and WARNING active simultaneously). The `warning` boolean flag on LRR/HRR cells already communicates it. Never set `state = "WARNING"` in `conviction_engine.py`.
- **`d_extended` boolean (dedicated field):** D has pushed more than 50% of the AB impulse beyond B → `d_extended = True`; B becomes the break level (persistent until new C forms)
  ```python
  ab_range = abs(B - A)
  d_extended = (D > B + 0.5 * ab_range)   # uptrend
  d_extended = (D < B - 0.5 * ab_range)   # downtrend
  ```
  Using 50% of AB (not BC) prevents shallow-C formations from producing a tiny extension threshold. The two formulas are equivalent when C is at the 50% retracement of AB; the AB-based formula is more stable across varying C depths.
  Reversion: when new C forms (D becomes new B, new C established) → `d_extended` resets to False; break level returns to new C
- **`d_extended` drives:** (1) B vs C selection in `_compute_warn_flags` and `is_warning`; (2) popup `*` asterisk on active break level (B when True, C when False); (3) the B-based break state machine in `compute_d_and_state` when extension threshold is crossed
- **`d_extended` is independent of `structural_state`** — when extension fires and price subsequently breaks B, state = `BREAK_OF_TRADE` / `BREAK_CONFIRMED` AND `d_extended = True`. The B/C context survives the state transition.
- **Daily overshoot flag (separate, tactical):** `signals.py` reads existing `signal_output.hrr` / `signal_output.lrr` before overwriting them; passes as `prior_ranges` to `compute_output`; conviction_engine compares today's close against those prior values → sets `lrr_extended` / `hrr_extended` Boolean fields. This is NOT `d_extended` — three independent concepts.
- **Daily overshoot display:** ↑ flag appears on HRR cell (bullish overshoot) or ↓ flag on LRR cell (bearish overshoot) with "do not chase" tooltip; state cell still shows UPTREND_VALID / DOWNTREND_VALID
- **BREAK_OF_TRADE does NOT change direction** — direction holds on the first close through the break level (provisional break, first-day forgiveness). Only `BREAK_CONFIRMED` (2+ consecutive closes) changes direction to Neutral.
- **BREAK_OF_TRADE = amber state cell; BREAK_CONFIRMED = red state cell** — visual distinction in `stateColor()`
- **States that force Neutral:** `BREAK_CONFIRMED` and `NO_STRUCTURE` only
- **UPTREND_VALID, DOWNTREND_VALID, BREAK_OF_TRADE, BREAK_OF_TREND** all allow Bullish/Bearish direction

### ABC Pivot Search — A Anchors at Most Extreme Confirmed Pivot (`pivot_engine.py`)
- **Old behavior:** `_find_uptrend_abc` / `_find_downtrend_abc` used backward-walk (C newest-first) with all A candidates — could select a sub-extreme A when a more extreme confirmed pivot existed in the window
- **Problem:** XLV trend — A=$158.77 (Nov 25) was selected even though $159.66 (Jan 7) and $160.20 (Feb 27) were higher confirmed pivot highs within the window. "You cannot go back to a lower A" when a higher confirmed high exists (downtrend). The correct structure was A=$160.20, B=$143.26, C=$149.67.
- **Fixed:** Forward-walk from the most extreme confirmed pivot:
  - Uptrend: `A = min(pivot_lows)` in window → B = first pivot high after A → C = first pivot low after B with C > A
  - Downtrend: `A = max(pivot_highs)` in window → B = first pivot low after A → C = first pivot high after B with C < A
  - A always anchors at the most extreme level — once a more extreme pivot exists, the older less-extreme A is discarded
- **Rule:** A is always the most extreme confirmed pivot in the lookback window — never retreat to a less extreme A

### A Lookback Window — `_MAX_A_LOOKBACK` (`pivot_engine.py`)
- Limits how far back A can be selected, preventing the engine from anchoring to pivots irrelevant to the timeframe
- **Values:** `trade=60 bars` (~3 months), `trend=150 bars` (~7.5 months), `lt=None` (no limit)
- Applied in `compute_pivots_for_timeframe` by filtering `pivot_highs` / `pivot_lows` before passing to `find_abc_structure`
- Full price history is still used for D computation and break detection — only the ABC search is constrained
- Distinct from `_STALE_C_DAYS` (which discards a structure after C gets too old): A lookback prevents an old irrelevant A from being selected in the first place
- When A eventually drops outside the lookback window (e.g. a long-running uptrend), the engine naturally re-anchors to the next most extreme pivot in the window — A advances to a higher low (uptrend) or lower high (downtrend) automatically
- **Rule:** Do not increase `_MAX_A_LOOKBACK["trade"]` above 60 bars — going back to September to anchor A for a 3-week trade timeframe is methodologically wrong
- **A-candidate iteration (V-recovery fix):** `_find_uptrend_abc` and `_find_downtrend_abc` iterate A candidates from most extreme to least extreme rather than returning None when the most extreme A has no confirmed B/C yet. This handles V-recoveries where the sell-off low is too recent to have produced a confirmed follow-through: the engine falls back to the prior structural A and finds the existing ABC. Trend re-establishes as soon as D reclaims the old C — the correct "resumption" signal — rather than waiting months for a new structure to build from the bottom. The 150-bar window is a known edge case: if the prior valid A sits outside 150 bars, the iteration exhausts all candidates and returns None. Accepted as a known limitation.

### B Advancement — `update_b_dynamically` (`pivot_engine.py`)
- B was historically fixed at the first confirmed pivot after A and never updated, making the BC range and d_extended threshold stale for the lifetime of the structure
- **Fixed:** After `update_c_dynamically` finalizes C, `update_b_dynamically` advances B to the **most recent** confirmed pivot high (uptrend) or pivot low (downtrend) between A_idx and C_idx
- B can advance to a higher OR lower price than the initial B — it always reflects the most recent structural reference point before C
- B is between A and C in **time** (index), not necessarily in price direction — A < C < B in price for uptrend; B < C < A in price for downtrend
- **D re-computes against new B:** if B advances past the previously established D level, D temporarily un-establishes until price closes through the new B — correct behavior since D must prove the trend beyond the new structural reference
- **d_extended uses updated B and BC range:** `bc_range = abs(new_B - new_C)`; d_extended fires when D > new_B + bc_range (uptrend) or D < new_B - bc_range (downtrend)
- **Warn flags use updated B (non-extended) or D (extended):** `hrr_warn = hrr < b` normally (uptrend); when `d_extended=True`, `hrr_warn = hrr < d` — the BB target is compared against D (the extended high), not B. B is the break level; D is the "can the target still reach the peak" reference. See `_compute_warn_flags` in `conviction_engine.py`.
- **Execution order in `compute_pivots_for_timeframe`:**
  1. `update_c_dynamically` — walks C to most recent valid structural level
  2. `update_b_dynamically` — advances B to most recent pivot between A and updated C
  3. `compute_d_and_state` — uses updated B + C for D, d_extended, and state
- **Rule:** Do not remove `update_b_dynamically` or swap its order with `update_c_dynamically` — C must be finalized before B can be correctly advanced

### Yahoo Finance `auto_adjust=False` — Actual Close Prices (`yahoo_finance.py`)
- Old behavior: `yf.Ticker().history()` uses `auto_adjust=True` by default — silently adjusts all historical closes for dividends, making stored prices diverge from actual traded prices
- **Problem:** SPY Aug 1 2025 showed $616.49 in cache vs $621.72 on Yahoo/ThinkorSwim — gap grows for older bars and any dividend-paying ticker
- **Fixed:** `auto_adjust=False` on both `history(period="5y")` and `history(period="5d")` calls in `yahoo_finance.py`
- This only affects Yahoo fallback path — Schwab always returns actual prices
- **After deploying this fix:** wipe local SQLite history (`UPDATE price_cache SET history_json=NULL, ... cache_date='1970-01-01'`) and run REFRESH DATA + CALCULATE SIGNALS to replace adjusted history with actual prices
- **Production:** safe — Schwab is primary for all equity/ETF tickers; Yahoo fallback only serves indices (SPX, VIX, etc.) and futures which pay no dividends, so `auto_adjust` has no effect on them
- **Do not** revert to default `auto_adjust=True`

### EOD Bar Inclusion Fix (`yahoo_finance.py`)
- Old behavior: `closes.index.date < date.today()` excluded today's close from `history_prices`
- **Problem:** When the scheduler fetches data at 4 PM ET, today's close IS the confirmed EOD price. Excluding it meant the 5th post-pivot bar didn't count until the next trading day — a confirmed pivot on Mar 20 wouldn't be used in that day's signal calculation even though the data was fetched after close.
- **Fixed:** `closes.index.date <= date.today()` — include today's EOD bar
- **Rule:** Do not revert to `<` — today's bar at EOD fetch time is always a confirmed close, not an intraday bar

### Pivot Engine: Intact Structure Preference + BREAK_CONFIRMED Spanning (`pivot_engine.py`)
- **Problem 1 — Spanning a prior break:** When both uptrend and downtrend ABCs are valid and the most-recent-C tiebreak is used, the winner could span a BREAK_CONFIRMED of a prior same-direction structure. The engine was reaching back to an A that predated a structural break, producing a phantom ABC (e.g. IWM: uptrend A=Nov 20, C=Mar 20 — but the uptrend had a BREAK_CONFIRMED Mar 5-6 at C=$260.03).
- **Problem 2 — BREAK_CONFIRMED beating intact structure:** GLD, AAPL, NVDA, TLT all had a broken structure in one direction winning over an intact structure in the other direction, causing them to show BREAK_CONFIRMED when a valid directional structure existed.
- **Fixed:** `_has_prior_break_confirmed()` — scans intermediate pivots between A and C of the candidate ABC for any historical BREAK_CONFIRMED; if found, the ABC is rejected and the other direction is used.
- **Fixed:** `_price_on_correct_side()` — before applying the most-recent-C tiebreak, prefer the structure where current price is still on the valid side of C (structure intact). A broken structure only wins if both structures are broken or both are intact.
- **Problem 3 — Prior break check skipped on intact-only early return:** When one structure was intact and the other broken, the intact one was returned immediately (lines 277-280) without calling `_has_prior_break_confirmed`. The check only fired on the tiebreak path (both intact or both broken). FXB example: intact uptrend (A=Nov19, C=Mar30) was returned over a valid downtrend (A=Feb25, B=Mar13, C=Mar23) because the uptrend was price-intact. The uptrend spans the Feb 18-19 BREAK_CONFIRMED — should have been rejected.
- **Fixed (2026-04-11):** Both early-return cases (lines 277-280) now call `_has_prior_break_confirmed` on the intact winner before returning. If a prior break is found, the other (broken) structure is returned instead.
- **Selection priority in `find_abc_structure()`:**
  1. Only one direction found → use it
  2. Both found, only one intact (price on correct side of C) → use intact, UNLESS it spans a prior BREAK_CONFIRMED → use broken structure instead
  3. Both intact or both broken → most recent C wins, UNLESS:
     a. The newer structure has never established D (price never closed through B) → older structure governs. D is the confirmation event: a geometric ABC without D is not a confirmed reversal and cannot override an unbroken prior structure.
     b. The winner spans a prior BREAK_CONFIRMED of a same-direction structure → use other.
- **`_d_has_established(abc, prices)`** — returns True if price has ever closed through B (above B for uptrend, below B for downtrend). Guards the tiebreak: without D, the newer ABC is geometric only.
- **Rule:** Do not simplify `find_abc_structure()` back to "most recent C wins" — the priority logic is load-bearing

### LT Bar Window Reduced: 90 → 50 (`pivot_engine.py`)
- Old `TIMEFRAMES["lt"] = 90` required 180 bars of surrounding context — major reversals were invisible for ~9 months after they occurred
- **Problem:** GLD's $495 peak (Jan 2026) was undetectable at bw=90 as late as April 2026 (~50 bars old); showed NO_STRUCTURE despite a clear multi-year uptrend
- **Fixed:** `TIMEFRAMES["lt"] = 50` — pivots need ~2.5 months of context each side; 5x the trend window (bw=10), still clearly "structural"
- **Rule:** Do not increase LT bar_window above 50 without verifying that 3–4 month old major reversals still register

### Trend Bar Window Reduced: 20 → 10 (`pivot_engine.py`)
- Old `TIMEFRAMES["trend"] = 20` required 40 bars of surrounding context to confirm a pivot, making it nearly impossible for the trend engine to detect a new reversal within 40 trading days (~2 months)
- **Problem:** MSFT's Jan-Mar 2026 collapse was invisible to the trend engine at bw=20 — trend showed NO_STRUCTURE / Neutral despite a clear downtrend
- **Fixed:** `TIMEFRAMES["trend"] = 10` — still provides meaningful trend-scale pivots while detecting reversals within ~20 trading days
- **Rule:** Do not increase trend bar_window above 10 without verifying that recent reversals (< 6 weeks) still register

### OBV Pivot Engine Replaces Price-Momentum Proxy (`conviction_engine.py`)
- Old `_volume_signal` used 5-day / 20-day price momentum — not real volume
- **Replaced with:** `_build_obv` + `_obv_direction` — ABCD pivot-based OBV trend detection
- Volume history stored in `price_cache.volume_history_json` (aligned to `history_json` dates)
- **OBV bar_window = 5** — matches the trade timeframe price pivot window; confirmed pivots require bar_window bars on both sides
- **`_obv_direction` uses ABCD logic** (mirrors price pivot engine) — NOT a 4-pivot HH+HL comparison:
  - Uptrend: A (most extreme OBV low in 60-bar window) → B (first confirmed high after A) → C (confirmed low after B where C > A) → D running > B → "Bullish"
  - Downtrend: A (most extreme OBV high) → B (first confirmed low after A) → C (confirmed high after B where C < A) → D running < B → "Bearish"
  - 60-bar lookback for pivot search — mirrors trade timeframe A lookback
  - Returns "Neutral" if ABCD structure not established in either direction
- **Old method (superseded):** compared last 2 pivot highs vs prior 2 pivot highs (HH+HL for Bullish). Removed because it required 4 confirmed pivots, lagged V-recoveries by weeks, and could return Bullish/Bearish before D was established
- **Vol Signal compared against Trade Dir** (not Viewpoint) — volume is a short-term signal; confirming/diverging against the trade timeframe move is methodologically correct
- Confirming = OBV direction matches Trade Dir; Diverging = opposes Trade Dir; Neutral = OBV has no structure or Trade Dir is Neutral
- Conviction math unaffected: multiplier only applies when Viewpoint ≠ Neutral, where Trade Dir always equals Viewpoint anyway
- `obv_direction` (Vol Direction) + `obv_confirming` (Vol Signal) stored in `signal_output`, served via `/api/signals/stored`
- Phase 5 swap point flagged with `# PHASE 5 TODO` in `yahoo_finance.py` — OBV engine is source-agnostic

### VIX Regime Threshold — Green Cutoff is 19 (`App.js`, `conviction_engine.py`)
- Correct thresholds: `VIX < 19` → Green (Investable), `19 ≤ VIX < 30` → Amber (Choppy/Edgy), `VIX ≥ 30` → Red (Danger)
- VIX = 19 is choppy territory — Investable requires VIX strictly below 19
- **Do not** use 20 as the cutoff

### Vol Signal / Vol Direction — Popup Field Naming (`App.js`)
- Backend field `vol_signal` (Confirming/Diverging/Neutral) is computed from OBV pivot direction vs Trade Dir — stored for popup display only; no longer drives a conviction multiplier (v1.8+)
- Popup shows two fields:
  - **Vol Direction** — raw OBV pivot trend direction: Bullish / Bearish / Neutral (maps to `obv_direction`)
  - **Vol Signal vs Trade** — Confirming ✓ / Diverging ✗ / Neutral — (maps to `obv_confirming`; compared against Trade Dir)
- The old duplicate "Vol Signal" row that appeared above OBV Direction was removed — it was a leftover from the price-momentum proxy era
- **Do not rename** `vol_signal` → `obv_signal` in the DB — "Vol Signal" is the correct trader-facing name

### Popup Trade Section Order (`App.js`)
- **Trade Dir and Trade State** are displayed side-by-side in the same row (dual-field `__dual__` renderer)
- **Order:** Trade Dir | Trade State → Trade LRR → Trade HRR → Trade B → Trade C
- **`__dual__` renderer** — special field type in the popup `fields` array: `["__dual__", [[label, val, color, isState, tip], ...]]`. Renders as a full-width subgrid containing two side-by-side cells. Used only for Trade Dir + Trade State.
- **Trade B before Trade C** — B is the prior swing reference; C is the active invalidation level. B shown first as structural context, C shown last as the actionable level.

### Warning Tooltip — C Pivot Price Injected Inline (`App.js`)
- LRR/HRR ⚠ tooltips now include the C pivot value inline: e.g. `"LRR is below C ($448.20) — approaching trade invalidation level"`
- `warnTip(dir, which, cVal, bVal, isExtended)` helper builds the tooltip string — formats price as `$X,XXX.XX`; when `isExtended=true` tooltip says "B replaces C" as the break level
- All call sites (table rows + popup) pass `row.tradeExtended` / `row.trendExtended` as the `isExtended` param — **not** `row.tradeState === "EXTENDED"`
- C and B pivot values flow from `signal_output.pivot_c` / `signal_output.pivot_b` via `mergeSignalData()` → `tradeC`, `tradeB`, `trendC`, `trendB`

### EXTENDED Architectural Cleanup — `d_extended` Boolean (`pivot_engine.py`, `conviction_engine.py`, `App.js`)
- **Problem:** EXTENDED was stored in `structural_state`, conflicting with other states (e.g. BREAK_OF_TRADE could not coexist with the "came from EXTENDED" context needed to keep B as break level) and lingering as a misleading label after SPX retraced from its March 2026 extreme.
- **Fix:** `d_extended` Boolean added to `signal_pivots` and `signal_output`. `structural_state` no longer contains "EXTENDED" or "WARNING" — clean set of six values only.
- **`d_extended`** turns ON when `D > B + abs(B-C)` (uptrend) / `D < B - abs(B-C)` (downtrend). Turns OFF when new C forms.
- **`is_warning` and `_compute_warn_flags`** now accept `d_extended: bool` param instead of `orig_state` — `break_level = b if d_extended else c`
- **`_compute_direction`** simplified — no EXTENDED case; pivot engine pre-handles B-based break state machine when d_extended is True
- **`compute_output`** no longer sets `state = "WARNING"` — `warning` is a boolean flag only; `structural_state` is never overridden
- **BREAK_OF_TRADE does NOT change direction** — `_compute_direction` returns Bullish/Bearish for BREAK_OF_TRADE/BREAK_OF_TREND; only BREAK_CONFIRMED returns Neutral
- **`stateColor()`** in `App.js` — BREAK_OF_TRADE/BREAK_OF_TREND → amber; BREAK_CONFIRMED → red; removed EXTENDED and WARN cases
- **`tradeBreakIsB` / `trendBreakIsB`** in popup — driven by `row.tradeExtended` / `row.trendExtended` (not state string check)
- **Alembic migration:** `e2f4a6b8c1d0` — adds `d_extended` to `signal_pivots` and `signal_output`
- **Verified:** SPX `state=BREAK_OF_TRADE`, `d_extended=True`, `hrr_warn=True` (HRR 6825 > B 6798), popup `*` on Trade B

### Filter UX — Dropdown Multi-Select (`App.js`)
- Asset Class button row replaced with `MultiSelectDropdown` component — compact, multi-select, count badge, click-outside-to-close
- New Sector dropdown added alongside Asset Class — same `MultiSelectDropdown` component
- Both dropdowns populate dynamically from the active ticker universe (no hardcoded values)
- Viewpoint, ALIGNED ONLY, and ALERTS filters unchanged (remain as buttons)
- Filters apply instantly on selection — no submit button

### Q FIT Column (`App.js`, `signals.py`)
- Sortable column showing whether a security's asset class historically performs well (▲), neutral (—), or poorly (▼) in the current macro quad environment
- **Viewpoint-independent** — purely "does this asset class/sector do well in this quad?" regardless of signal direction
  - `quad_fit` field: `"Best"` | `"Neutral"` | `"Worst"` — computed on-the-fly in `/api/signals/stored`
  - Uses `get_quad_alignment(ac, sec, quad)` → `+1.0` / `0.0` / `-1.0` → maps to `"Best"` / `"Neutral"` / `"Worst"`
  - **NOT** `quad_alignment` (which is viewpoint-dependent: "Aligned"/"Misaligned"/"Neutral")
- **International Equities:** use country quarterly quad (same `_SECTOR_TO_CODE` + quarterly lookup as `run_output()`)
- **US all other asset classes:** use US monthly quad for current ET month
- `qFitSort` numeric key: `Best=1`, `Neutral=0`, `Worst=-1` — correct sort ordering
- Column placed before the quad month columns (Q FIT → Now → Next)
- `QUARTERLY QUADS` label floated right on the International Equities separator row (above the quad columns)
- **Rule:** Never use `sig.quad_alignment` for Q FIT — it is viewpoint-dependent and will show ▼ for bearish securities in bullish-tailwind quads

### QUAD MAP Button (`App.js`)
- Styled button (matches filter button aesthetic) sitting left of the "N of N instruments" count in the filter/sort bar
- Opens a modal overlay showing `public/quad-map.png` (Expected Performance by Quad reference image)
- Click outside the image or ✕ to close; `quadMapOpen` state controls visibility
- To update the image: replace `public/quad-map.png` and redeploy — no code changes needed
- **Legend bar removed** — the color/threshold legend at the bottom of the page was removed; tooltips on each cell cover this information

### ENTRY Signal Column — Proximity-Based (v1.7) (`App.js`)
- `entrySignal` is computed in the `ALL_DATA` useMemo pipeline: `"BUY"` | `"SELL"` | `null`
- **BUY conditions:** Viewpoint = Bullish AND Trade Dir = Bullish AND Trend Dir = Bullish AND `prox_bullish > 0.85`
  - `prox_bullish = 1 - (close - tradeLRR) / (tradeHRR - tradeLRR)` — peaks at 1.0 when close = LRR
- **SELL conditions:** Viewpoint = Bearish AND Trade Dir = Bearish AND Trend Dir = Bearish AND `prox_bearish > 0.85`
  - `prox_bearish = (close - tradeLRR) / (tradeHRR - tradeLRR)` — peaks at 1.0 when close = HRR
- **Replaces:** 2%-of-price absolute threshold — not normalized to instrument volatility
- **Why prox > 0.85 works:** HRR - LRR is derived from STD20 → already volatility-scaled per instrument. prox > 0.85 = within bottom 15% of the range (from entry side) for any ticker
- Neutral viewpoint never triggers ENTRY signal regardless of price proximity
- Sort comparator must handle `null` — `typeof null === "object"` causes NaN on subtraction
- **Fix:** Null values explicitly sorted to bottom before string/numeric comparison in the sort function
- `ENTRY` count shown in header summary row alongside BULLISH / BEARISH / ALIGNED / ALERTS

### Schwab IV — ATM Option Contracts, IV Rank Formula (`schwab_options.py`)
- **DO NOT** read the top-level `volatility` field from `get_option_chain()` response — it is historical/realized vol, not implied vol
- **Correct source:** `_extract_atm_iv(data)` — parses `callExpDateMap` / `putExpDateMap`, interpolates to 30-day constant-maturity IV matching TOS methodology
- **30-day interpolation:** finds the two expirations bracketing 30 DTE (near < 30, far ≥ 30), computes ATM IV at each (average call + put), linearly interpolates → `IV_near × (far_dte - 30) / span + IV_far × (30 - near_dte) / span`; falls back to nearest available if only one side of 30 DTE exists
- Individual option `volatility` is a decimal (e.g. `0.318` for 31.8%) — no ÷100 needed; guard: if value > 2.0 it's percentage format, divide by 100
- **IV Rank formula** (matches TOS "IV Percentile"): `(current_iv - min_252) / (max_252 - min_252) * 100` — range-based, NOT `percentileofscore` frequency-based
- Cold start: returns `50` when fewer than 5 observations in `vol_history`
- Updates `price_cache.rel_iv` (replaces Yahoo proxy) + sets `price_cache.iv_source = 'schwab'`
- **Per-ticker fallback:** on any per-ticker error, leaves Yahoo proxy `rel_iv` intact and tags `iv_source = 'proxy'`
- **No-tokens fallback:** if Schwab token missing/expired, entire batch tagged `'proxy'` immediately — no options calls made
- `iv_source` exposed in `serialize_cache_row()` in `market_data.py` — popup label shows `IV% — schwab` or `IV% — proxy`
- **Production reset required after this fix:** run `DELETE FROM vol_history;` in Supabase SQL editor — old rows used wrong source field and will corrupt IV Rank if left in

### Volatility Metrics Expansion — HV30/HV90, IV30, Risk Reversal, Skew Rank, P/C Ratio (`schwab_options.py`)
- **All vol metrics come exclusively from `schwab_fetch_iv`** — HV30/HV90 are NOT computed in `schwab_market_data.py` from Yahoo data. All-or-nothing: if Schwab tokens unavailable, all new vol fields remain null (no partial population from Yahoo)
- **HV30/HV90 — Annualized Realized Volatility:**
  - `hv30` = std of last 21 log returns × √252 (≈ 30 calendar days); `hv90` = std of last 63 log returns × √252 (≈ 90 calendar days)
  - Computed from `price_cache.history_json` inside `_compute_hv(db, ticker)` — no additional API call needed
  - Naming convention: 21 trading days ≈ 30 calendar days; 63 trading days ≈ 90 calendar days (matches IV30 tenor)
- **`strike_count = 20`** — raised from 1 to capture 25Δ OTM options (20 strikes each side of ATM); required for skew extraction
- **25Δ Risk Reversal — `_extract_25d_skew(data, atm_iv)`:**
  - Uses **strike-based Black-Scholes approximation** — NOT delta field. Schwab omits delta for OTM options; relying on delta caused code to land on ATM options (delta≈0.5) instead of true 25Δ options, producing near-zero risk reversals (~0.4% vs correct ~-6%)
  - Computes expected 25Δ strikes from underlying price and ATM IV:
    - `K_call_25d = S × exp( 0.6745 × σ × √T + 0.5 × σ² × T)` — call delta = 0.25 → N(d1)=0.25 → d1=-0.6745
    - `K_put_25d  = S × exp(-0.6745 × σ × √T + 0.5 × σ² × T)` — put delta = -0.25 → N(d1)=0.75 → d1=+0.6745
    - where `0.6745 = N⁻¹(0.75)`, `T = DTE/252`, `σ = ATM IV30` (or 0.30 fallback)
  - Finds the strike in the chain closest to each computed target; reads that strike's IV
  - Interpolates to 30-day constant maturity using same near/far bracket as IV30
  - `risk_reversal = call_iv_25d - put_iv_25d`; positive = forward skew = institutional call buying = bullish; negative = normal smirk = downside protection bid (typical for equities)
  - `atm_iv` is passed from call site: `_extract_25d_skew(data, atm_iv=implied_vol)`
  - **Do NOT revert to delta-based selection** — Schwab's delta field is unreliable for OTM options
- **Skew Rank — `_compute_skew_rank(db, ticker, today_rr)`:**
  - Risk reversal rank within its own 252-day rolling history: `(rr - min) / (max - min) × 100`
  - Same methodology as IV Rank; requires `_RANK_MIN_HISTORY = 30` observations before meaningful
- **Put/Call Ratio — `_extract_put_call_ratio(data)`:**
  - Total put OI ÷ total call OI across all fetched strikes and expirations
  - `> 1.2` = fear/capitulation (contrarian bullish); `< 0.6` = complacency
- **vol_history renamed columns:** `rv21` → `hv30`, `rv63` → `hv90` (migration `k1a2b3c4d5e6`)
- **vol_history new columns:** `call_iv_25d`, `put_iv_25d`, `risk_reversal`, `skew_rank`, `put_call_ratio` (migration `k1a2b3c4d5e6`; `skew_rank` added migration `08f62d15c8b7`)
- **vol_history `vol_premium` renamed to `vrp`** (migration `m3c4d5e6f7g8`) — VRP = IV30 − HV30; positive = options expensive vs realized; negative = cheap
- **price_cache new columns:** `hv30`, `hv90`, `iv30`, `risk_reversal`, `skew_rank` (Integer), `put_call_ratio` (migration `l2b3c4d5e6f7`); `vrp_rank` Integer (migration `m3c4d5e6f7g8`)
- **VRP (Volatility Risk Premium):** `vrp = IV30 − HV30`; stored in `vol_history.vrp` daily. Positive = options expensive vs realized vol; negative = options cheap. Renamed from `vol_premium`.
- **VRP Rank:** rank of `vrp` within its own 252-day rolling history: `(vrp - min_252) / (max_252 - min_252) × 100`. Stored in `price_cache.vrp_rank` (Integer 0–100). Low = options historically cheap vs realized = green; High = historically expensive = red. Requires `_RANK_MIN_HISTORY = 30` observations. Computed by `_compute_vrp_rank()` in `schwab_options.py` (mirrors `_compute_skew_rank`).
- **IV30 vs Schwab "Implied Volatility":** Our IV30 is constant-maturity 30-day interpolated ATM IV (TOS methodology). Schwab's "Implied Volatility" stat in the Options Statistics panel is front-month ATM IV without maturity adjustment — will differ by ~2-4% due to term structure. Both are correct; they measure different things. Constant-maturity is methodologically cleaner for cross-asset comparison.
- **Idempotency:** checked against `vol_history` table (not `price_cache.iv_source`) — `vol_history` must be cleared to force re-fetch: `DELETE FROM vol_history WHERE iv_date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'`

### vol_history Table — Rename + HV-Only Accumulation (`schwab_options.py`, `scheduler.py`)
- **`iv_history` renamed to `vol_history`** (migration `n1o2p3q4r5s6`) — table stores all vol metrics (IV30, HV30, HV90, VRP, skew), not just implied vol; name was misleading
- **`IVHistory` model → `VolHistory`** in `models/vol_history.py`; `models/iv_history.py` is superseded (no longer imported)
- **`accumulate_hv_only(db)`** in `schwab_options.py` — writes daily HV30/HV90 rows to `vol_history` for Yahoo-only tickers (SPX, NDX, RUT, VIX, $DJI, USD, JPY, /CL, /ZN, /GC, VVIX). `implied_vol`, `vrp`, `risk_reversal` etc. all NULL. Runs in the 4 PM scheduler job after `schwab_fetch_iv()`.
- **HV Rank label** — popup `iv_source = 'proxy'` now shows **"HV Rank"** (was "IV Rank — proxy"). The proxy was never implied vol — it was 21-day realized vol ranked within its 252-day history. Tooltip updated to match. `iv_source = 'schwab'` → "IV Rank — schwab" (unchanged). `iv_source = 'price_rank'` → "VVIX Rank — price" (unchanged).
- **Migration note:** `create_all()` on startup auto-created an empty `vol_history` table before the migration ran; migration handles this by dropping the empty table first before renaming `iv_history`

### HV Rank Column + One-Time HV Backfill (`price_cache.hv_rank`, `scripts/backfill_hv.py`)
- **`price_cache.hv_rank`** Integer 0–100 column added (migration `p1q2r3s4t5u6`) — HV30 rank within its own 252-day rolling history. Mirrors `vrp_rank`/`skew_rank`/`iv_pct` pattern. Low rank = realized vol historically calm; high rank = vol elevated.
- **`_compute_hv_rank(db, ticker, today_hv30)`** in `schwab_options.py` — `(today - min_252) / (max_252 - min_252) × 100`, requires `_RANK_MIN_HISTORY = 30` observations.
- **Wired into both daily paths:** `schwab_fetch_iv` (passes `hv_rank` to `_update_price_cache_iv`) AND `accumulate_hv_only` (Yahoo-only tickers — SPX, NDX, RUT, VIX, $DJI, USD, JPY, /CL, /ZN, /GC, VVIX).
- **Bug fix in `accumulate_hv_only`:** previously wrote HV30/HV90 to `vol_history` only — never to `price_cache`. That's why all 11 Yahoo-only tickers showed no HV in the popup despite valid history. Now stamps `pc.hv30 / hv90 / hv_rank` on the latest fetch.
- **One-time backfill — `backend/scripts/backfill_hv.py`:** walks `history_json` + `history_dates_json` per ticker, computes daily HV30/HV90 series, upserts into `vol_history` preserving existing IV/VRP/skew. Recomputes `vrp = iv30 - hv30` wherever IV is present. Stamps current `hv30/hv90/hv_rank/vrp_rank` on `price_cache`. Idempotent — safe to re-run.
  ```bash
  # Local (Docker → SQLite):
  docker exec -e SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING= -e SUPABASE_POOLED_CONNECTION_STRING= \
      -e DATABASE_URL= signal-matrix-backend-1 python -m scripts.backfill_hv [--dry-run]
  # Production (Fly.io → Supabase):
  fly ssh console --app signal-matrix-api -C "python -m scripts.backfill_hv"
  ```
- **Backfill rationale:** HV columns added recently in migration `k1a2b3c4d5e6` were never backfilled — `vol_history` had only ~13–16 days of HV history vs. 266 days of IV. Backfill produces ~1250 HV rows per ticker (5 years of daily history), making HV Rank a true 252-day rank from day one.

### Conviction Score — Additive Formula (v2.0)
- **Architecture: four independent components summed** — replaces v1.9 multiplier chain. Proximity removed entirely.
- **Formula:**
  ```
  conviction_final = structural_score + quad_score + volume_score + vix_score
                   → floor(0) → ×0.92 dampener (if target-side warn) → ×1.05 NATH boost → cap(105)
  ```

- **Component 1 — Structural (max 50):**
  ```python
  if trade_dir == trend_dir and trade_dir != "Neutral":
      structural_score = 50   # both Bullish or both Bearish — full alignment
  elif trade_dir != "Neutral" and trend_dir == "Neutral":
      structural_score = 25   # trade only
  elif trade_dir == "Neutral" and trend_dir != "Neutral":
      structural_score = 25   # trend only (unusual but valid)
  else:
      structural_score = 0    # both Neutral, OR opposing directions (conflicted = no conviction)
  ```
  Opposing (Trade=Bullish, Trend=Bearish) → 0. Both timeframes have form but disagree — no structural conviction.

- **Component 2 — Quad (+20 / 0 / −15, prob-weighted):**
  - `alignment = get_quad_alignment(asset_class, sector, current_quad)` → +1.0 / 0.0 / -1.0
  - `structural_score == 0` AND Viewpoint = Neutral → `quad_score = 0` (no directional evidence in either timeframe)
  - `structural_score == 25` (one timeframe confirmed, one Neutral) → quad allowed to contribute. Strong uptrends can prevent trade ABC from confirming — macro tailwind still meaningful when at least one timeframe has direction.
  - Aligned (alignment > 0), prob ≥ 0.45 → **+20**; prob < 0.45 → **+15**
  - Neutral (alignment = 0) → **0**
  - Misaligned (alignment < 0), prob ≥ 0.45 → **−15**; prob < 0.45 → **−11**
  - Probability threshold 0.45 (above random 0.25, meaningful directional read)
  - `quad_mult` column still written to `signal_output` for debug — **informational only**, not in formula, not shown in popup
  - `quad_score` (Integer) now stored in `signal_output` and shown in popup — additive contribution +20/+15/0/−11/−15

- **Component 3 — Volume (max 15):**
  - OBV direction: 40-bar linear regression slope normalized by std(OBV[-40:]); `|normalized| ≤ 0.02` → Neutral
  - `obv_confirming`: strict — regression direction AND OBV MA20 slope (3-bar ROC) both confirm Trade Dir
  - `volume_score = 0`; if `obv_confirming`: `+10`; if also slope accelerating (uptrend: increasing / downtrend: decreasing): `+5` boost
  - Misaligned OBV → **0** (no penalty; caution shown in popup Vol Signal)

- **Component 4 — VIX/Vol (max 15, Domestic Equities only):**
  - `vix_score`: VIX < 19 AND VIX HRR < 19 → **+15** (Investable — vol firmly locked below threshold); VIX < 19 (HRR still elevated) → **+10**; 19–23 → **+5** (Edgy); 24–29 → **0** (Choppy); ≥ 30 → **0** (Danger)
  - VIX HRR sourced from `signal_output` where ticker='VIX', timeframe='trade' — yesterday's stored value
  - All other asset classes: `+15` (no VIX penalty, full credit)
  - Missing VIX row → `+15` (default full credit, no crash assumed)

- **Dampener (×0.92):** applied after floor, before cap. Fires when target-side warn is active:
  - Uptrend: `hrr_warn` fires (HRR < D when d_extended, HRR < B normally) → momentum fading
  - Downtrend: `lrr_warn` fires (LRR > D when d_extended, LRR > B normally) → momentum fading

- **NATH Boost (×1.05):** applied after dampener, before cap. Fires when Viewpoint = Bullish AND trade HRR > `price_cache.ath` (HRR projects above all-time high). Mirrors the ×0.92 dampener — "buy every dip" signal when structure + target both point to new highs.

- **Display and alert rules (v2.0):**
  - Conviction **always calculates** regardless of Viewpoint
  - **Display threshold: ≥ 45** — blank below; shown when ≥ 45
  - **Neutral viewpoint:** shows conviction in grey (`#8899aa`) when ≥ 45; never fires alert
  - **Alert threshold: ≥ 80** — requires non-Neutral viewpoint AND conviction ≥ 80
  - Why 45: structural max = 50; below 45 = partial structure AND at least one other component unfavorable
  - Why 80: full structural (50) + quad aligned (20) + partial VIX (10) = 80

- **OBV signals (v2.0):**
  - `obv_direction`: 40-bar linear regression slope on OBV series, normalized by std(OBV[-40:]); `|norm| ≤ 0.02` → Neutral. `_OBV_NEUTRAL_BAND = 0.02` (calibrated vs IWM/SPY/GLD)
  - `obv_confirming`: True when obv_direction == Trade Dir AND obv_slope == 'rising'/'falling' confirms Trade Dir
  - `obv_slope_trend`: 'increasing' | 'decreasing' | 'flat' — acceleration check for +5 volume boost
  - `vol_signal` (Confirming/Diverging/Neutral): stored for popup display only

- **Quad Alignment lookup (`get_quad_alignment`) — unchanged:**
  - Sector takes priority over asset_class (USD, Gold, Yen, British Pound, Euro, etc. use sector key)
  - Returns +1.0 (Best), 0.0 (Neutral), -1.0 (Worst) for current quad
  - See `QUAD_ALIGNMENT` dict in `conviction_engine.py` for full quad×category matrix

- **IWM sanity check (v2.0):** Structural +50 + Quad +20 + Volume +15 + VIX +15 = 100 (base max). NATH boost (×1.05) can push to 105 when trade HRR projects above ATH. v1.9 was 64.63 (suppressed by proximity). v2.0 correctly scores 100 when all components genuinely favorable.

- Old formula history: v1.6: H-based; v1.7: H_eff×100 + prox; v1.8: base50+prox+OBV+VIX; v1.9: 5-layer multiplier chain — all superseded by v2.0 additive

### Trade LRR/HRR — v1.9.1 Formula (Dynamic-N BB + Snap)
- **Spec:** `Docs/SignalMatrix_RR_v1_9_1.txt` (authoritative)
- **Supersedes:** v1.8 fixed-N (20) BB + ATR buffer + MA20-regime switch. ATR + MA20 regime are no longer in the trade RR path. ATR / MA20 / STD20 / `ma20_regime` columns remain on `price_cache` (no schema churn) but stop driving the trade band.

- **Framework:** Dynamic-N Bollinger Band (N from 8 to 15, driven by IV30 percentile rank — HV30 fallback) with stateful snap mechanic on the trailing side that compresses the band toward MA during impulses. EOD-batch: today's `closes[-1]` is today's confirmed close (post-4 PM fetch); the band computed tonight is the operative RR for tomorrow's session. No forward displacement.

- **Constants** (TOS-validated values, hardcoded in `conviction_engine.py`):
  ```
  rank_lookback     = 252
  hv_period_bars    = 21    # 21 returns → HV30 (annualized × √252)
  snap_window       = 22    # snap trigger window
  proximity_smooth  = 3     # 3-bar EMA on proximity_raw, α=0.5
  k_wide            = 2.0   # standard BB multiplier (no snap)
  k_extend          = 2.2   # leading impulse side (opposite the snap)
  k_max             = 1.0   # snap side: max offset from MA
  k_min             = 0.0   # snap side: floor — fully collapses to MA at peak impulse
  k_decay           = 0.5   # how fast k shrinks as proximity grows
  ```
  Spec defaults differed (k_extend=2.0, k_max=1.0, k_min=0.3); the constants
  above reflect post-tuning values that better match Hedgeye visually on SPX/GOOGL/AMZN.

- **Vol source — IV-primary, HV-fallback (per ticker):**
  - **Primary:** IV30 from `vol_history.implied_vol`, ranked over its trailing 252-day window
  - **Fallback:** HV30 from `vol_history.hv30` when ticker has < 252 IV obs
  - Per-ticker decision (no source-mixing within one ticker's calc); auto-promotes to IV when enough history accumulates
  - σ in the bands stays **price-derived** — `std(closes[-N:], ddof=0)` (population std, matches ToS `StDev()` and Bollinger Band convention). IV/HV only drives N selection.
  - **Note:** spec says HV-only with IV "deferred to post-Schwab phase" — that wording is stale. IV history matured to 266+ days during Phase 5; v1.9.1 ships with IV-primary.

- **Computation (per spec Steps 1–8, v1.9.2 directional proximity):**
  1. Read 255+ values of IV30 (or HV30 fallback) from `vol_history`, ascending date
  2. Determine `N_t` for each of last 3 bars (today, yesterday, day-before): rank vol value within its 252-bar trailing window → 8-bucket lookup
  3. For each of those 3 bars compute **directional** proximity (signed, not absolute):
     - `prox_lrr[t] = (close[t] − ma_N_t) / std_N_t` — positive when price above MA, negative below
     - `prox_hrr[t] = (ma_N_t − close[t]) / std_N_t` — positive when price below MA, negative above
  4. EMA-3 each series independently (α=0.5, seed = oldest): → `prox_lrr`, `prox_hrr`
  5. Per-side directional k — clamped to [k_min, **k_wide**]:
     - `k_lrr_dyn = min(k_wide, max(k_min, k_max − k_decay × prox_lrr))`
     - `k_hrr_dyn = min(k_wide, max(k_min, k_max − k_decay × prox_hrr))`
     - When `prox_lrr` goes negative (price below MA during LRR snap), raw k grows past k_max toward k_wide; `min(k_wide)` clamp pulls snap line *down* to the BB instead of up into falling price — eliminates LRR inversion
  6. Snap trigger (today's close vs prior 22 closes): `is_22d_low_close = close[-1] <= min(closes[-23:-1])`; mirror for high (unchanged)
  7. **Dual release conditions** per side (trigger takes priority over release):
     - **Merge**: unclamped k reaches k_wide → snap line == standard BB. Fires on gradual pullbacks (merge threshold ≈ prox = −1.2, i.e. price 1.2σ below MA). Seamless transition.
     - **Breach**: today's **low** < yesterday's published snap_lrr (or today's **high** > yesterday's published snap_hrr). Uses intraday extreme to catch tests that recover by close. Yesterday's snap line is reconstructed from a 2-bar EMA (bars -3, -2) using bar -2 ma/std — approximates the level visible to the trader at the open.
     - Coincidence rule: LRR wins if both True
  8. Bands: `lrr = snap_lrr` / `hrr = snap_hrr` when snapped; opposing side uses `MA ± k_extend × σ`; no-snap = `MA ± k_wide × σ`

- **8-bucket N lookup** (right-inclusive on each upper bound):
  ```
  rank ≤ 10  → N=8     # very low vol regime
  rank ≤ 20  → N=9
  rank ≤ 35  → N=10
  rank ≤ 50  → N=11
  rank ≤ 64  → N=12
  rank ≤ 79  → N=13
  rank ≤ 89  → N=14
  rank > 89  → N=15    # very high vol regime
  ```

- **Snap state — persistent across runs**: `signal_output.hrr_snapped` / `lrr_snapped` BOOLEAN columns (migration `q2r3s4t5u6v7`) + same on `signal_history`. `compute_output()` loads prior values before each call, persists new state after. Each flag updates independently; coincidence rule fires when both would be True simultaneously (vanishingly rare structurally), LRR wins (uptrend bias).

- **Snap trigger uses CLOSES, not high/low** — today's close vs prior 22 closes. Intraday wicks are filtered out — the snap requires the day to actually commit to a 22-day extreme. Per spec Step 5.

- **Cold start:** `len(closes) < 273` (272 + today, where 272 = 252 rank window + 21 oldest HV input bars) → returns `(None, None, False, False)`. Same defensive pattern as the prior insufficient-history path.

- **Function signature change** (v1.8 → v1.9.1):
  ```python
  # v1.8:
  compute_trade_lrr_hrr(ma20, std20, ma20_regime, pivot_dir, close, atr) -> (lrr, hrr)
  # v1.9.1:
  compute_trade_lrr_hrr(closes, vol_series, prior_hrr_snapped, prior_lrr_snapped)
      -> (lrr, hrr, hrr_snapped, lrr_snapped)
  ```
  Math function stays pure (no DB I/O). Caller (`compute_output`) handles snap state read/write from `signal_output`. New helper `get_trade_rr_vol_series(ticker, db) -> (vol_series, source)` returns the IV/HV series and which source was used.

- **Helper: `get_trade_rr_vol_series`** in `conviction_engine.py` — queries last ~258 rows of `vol_history` (IV first, HV fallback), returns `(values_ascending, "iv"|"hv"|None)`. Single batched DB call per ticker.

- **Validation** — bands match Hedgeye published RRs within ~0.5% drift on SPX, GOOGL, AMZN visually verified in ToS during spec authoring. The TOS reference indicator uses forward displacement (maN[1]/sdN[1]) to prevent intraday repaint; Signal Matrix uses today's close directly (EOD-batch, no repaint risk) — this produces a one-bar offset relative to ToS plotted band, which is intentional and correct.

### Trend Level and Tail Level — Single MA (v1.7, replaces dual LRR/HRR for Trend and LT)
- **Supersedes:** Dual Trend LRR/HRR and LT LRR/HRR bands — only one level per timeframe now
- **Trend Level:** Break pivot (C normally; B when `d_extended=True`), shown when Trend Dir ≠ Neutral. MA100 slope check removed — always shows the active invalidation level.
  - Uptrend: green floor (buy/add zone); Downtrend: red ceiling (sell/short zone)
- **Tail Level:** MA200, shown only when LT Dir ≠ Neutral AND 20-day slope confirms direction
- **Code/DB key unchanged:** still `"lt"` everywhere in models and DB; display label only is "Tail"
- **Trend HRR removed from table and popup** — only one level per Trend/Tail timeframe

### MA20_TP Center Dropped (`conviction_engine.py`, `schwab_market_data.py`) — historical
- **MA20_TP (typical price center)** was added as a v1.8 interim: TP = (H+L+C)/3 resists downward movement during sell days
- **Removed (migration `13fb636fe76a`):** TP center improvement over MA20(close) was negligible (±7 pts on SPX). Not worth the schema complexity.
- `price_cache.ma20_tp` and `price_cache.std20_tp` columns dropped; `_compute_tp_metrics()` function removed; no TP writes anywhere.
- **Note (v1.9.1):** v1.8 used MA20(close) as the BB center. v1.9.1 superseded that with dynamic-N MA computed per-run from `closes[-N:]`, where `N` is selected by IV/HV percentile rank. `price_cache.ma20` still populates for legacy/inspection but is not consumed by the trade RR formula. Do not re-add MA20_TP.

### H/L History 3-Bar Alignment Fix (One-Time Data Migration)
- **Root cause:** When `history_high_json` / `history_low_json` columns were first added (migration `f7a3b2c1d9e6`), the initial "short" fill started 3 trading days later than the existing close history. Those 3 leading dates never received H/L values, leaving every ticker's H/L array 3 bars shorter than its close array.
- **Symptom:** `highs[i]` contained data for `dates[i+3]`, not `dates[i]` — ATR calculations for 14-day windows touching that zone were incorrect (inflated, since misaligned H/L appeared to spike relative to close).
- **Fix (2026-04-14):** One-time data script padded the front of `history_high_json` and `history_low_json` with the close price for the missing dates (H=L=C proxy), making all arrays equal-length. ATR was recomputed from the corrected arrays for all 63 local (SQLite) and 79 production (Supabase) tickers.
- **Code is correct:** Both the Schwab path (`_schwab_fetch` uses candles directly) and Yahoo path (`fetch_ticker_data` uses `.reindex(history_closes.index)`) correctly align H/L to close dates. The misalignment was a legacy bootstrap artifact only.
- **All future fetches:** append/skip/short/bootstrap paths all preserve or rebuild correct alignment — no ongoing issue.
- **Rule:** If adding new OHLC-based columns (e.g. ATR variants), always verify `len(history_high_json) == len(history_json)` after the first data run.

### Supabase Direct Connection — IPv6 Only from Docker (`alembic/env.py`)
- `db.wxqioudsteiwaazrgbao.supabase.co:5432` resolves to **IPv6 only** inside the Docker container
- Docker Desktop on Windows does not route IPv6 egress — connection fails with "Network is unreachable"
- **Fix:** Use `SUPABASE_POOLED_CONNECTION_STRING` for all `alembic` CLI runs from Docker
- Pooled host (`aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543`) resolves to IPv4 and is reachable from Docker
- `alembic/env.py` prefers `SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` but falls back to `SUPABASE_POOLED_CONNECTION_STRING` automatically
- **Do not** attempt alembic migrations via the direct connection string from inside Docker

### Supabase Runtime Uses psycopg2 Sync Engine — Not asyncpg (`database.py`)
- All FastAPI routers use synchronous SQLAlchemy (`Session`, `Depends(get_db)`) — asyncpg would require rewriting every router
- `database.py` converts `SUPABASE_POOLED_CONNECTION_STRING` (which has `postgresql+asyncpg://` prefix) to `postgresql+psycopg2://` via `_make_sync_url()`
- `_make_sync_url()` also URL-encodes the password — the Supabase password contains `@`, `#`, `/` characters that break standard URL parsing if raw
- **Do not** use `create_async_engine` or `AsyncSession` until a deliberate async migration is planned for all routers
- The `asyncpg` package is still in `requirements.txt` (Alembic dependency + future use) but is not used by the running app

### Fly.io Web App — Production Build Required (nginx, not CRA dev server)
- CRA dev server (`npm start`) exits immediately with code 0 on Fly.io Firecracker VMs (no TTY, headless)
- Root cause was two bugs stacked: (1) no `.dockerignore` → `COPY . .` overwrote Linux node_modules with Windows binaries → instant clean exit; (2) 256MB Firecracker VM too small for webpack compilation
- **Fix:** `Dockerfile.web.fly` uses a multi-stage build — `npm run build` on Depot's cloud builder (plenty of RAM), then `nginx:alpine` serves the static `build/` folder at runtime
- Image size: 23MB (vs 403MB dev server image)
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` is baked in at build time via Docker `ARG` + `ENV`, set in `fly.web.toml` `[build.args]`
- `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` must also be passed as a build arg — it is NOT available as a Fly.io runtime secret (React env vars bake in at build time)
- **Rule:** Never deploy CRA with `npm start` to Fly.io — always `npm run build` → nginx
- **Rule:** `.dockerignore` must always exclude `node_modules` — Windows binaries will crash Linux containers
- **Rule:** All web deploys must use `deploy-web.sh` — never bare `fly deploy` (password won't bake in)

### nginx SPA Routing — React Router 404 on Direct URL
- Default nginx config has no fallback rule — `/admin` and any non-root route returns 404 Not Found
- **Fix:** `nginx.conf` in project root with `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html` — copied into image via `Dockerfile.web.fly`
- Requires `COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` in `Dockerfile.web.fly`
- **Rule:** Any new React route added to the app works automatically — no nginx changes needed

### Web Deploy Script — `deploy-web.sh`
- All web deploys run via `./deploy-web.sh` in project root — never bare `fly deploy`
- Script sources `.env` to pick up `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and passes it as `--build-arg`
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` still set via `fly.web.toml` `[build.args]` — no duplication needed
- `deploy-web.sh` is safe to commit (reads from `.env`, contains no secrets)

### Fly.io Secrets — Special Characters in Passwords
- Fly.io's dotenv-style secret storage mangles passwords containing `#` (comment delimiter) and `$` (variable expansion)
- Password `k,/2#RY@Jma$8rw` stored as `SUPABASE_POOLED_CONNECTION_STRING` was silently truncated by `#`
- **Fix:** Store a pre-encoded `DATABASE_URL` secret where the password is already percent-encoded: `k%2C%2F2%23RY%40Jma%248rw` — no special chars to mangle
- `database.py` checks `DATABASE_URL` first, falls back to `SUPABASE_POOLED_CONNECTION_STRING` (with `_make_sync_url()` encoding pass)
- **Rule:** For any Fly.io secret containing `#`, `$`, `@`, `,`, or `/` in the password, pre-encode to percent-encoding before setting

### yfinance Asset Class Mapping — ETFs Default to Domestic Equities
- yfinance returns `quoteType: 'ETF'` for most ETFs but `category` is often empty or uses Morningstar taxonomy
- The mapping layer falls through to `Domestic Equities` default for international, fixed income, FX, and commodity ETFs
- **Fix:** `ASSET_CLASS_OVERRIDES` dict in `backend/routers/tickers.py` — checked first before any inference
- **Rule:** When adding new ETFs via admin panel, always verify asset class after lookup and correct if needed
- **Known good overrides already in place:** TLT, LQD, HYG, CLOX (Fixed Income); EWG, EWQ, EWP, KWT, KWEB, EWJ, EWW, TUR, UAE (International); GLD, SGOL, FXB, FXE, FXY (FX); USO, SLV, PALL, PPLT, CANE, WOOD, CORN, WEAT (Commodities); IBIT (Digital Assets)

### Futures Tickers — 3-File Checklist
Futures use continuous front-month symbols stored with a leading slash (e.g. `/CL`). Schwab does not serve continuous futures contracts via its standard quotes API, so all futures route through Yahoo Finance (which uses `XX=F` format for continuous series).

**When adding any new futures ticker:**
1. **`YAHOO_SYMBOL_MAP`** in `yahoo_finance.py` — add `"/XX": "XX=F"` mapping
2. **`SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED`** in `schwab_market_data.py` — add `"/XX"` so it always routes to Yahoo
3. **`IV_INELIGIBLE`** in `schwab_options.py` — add `"/XX"` to skip options chain fetch

**Currently configured futures:**
- `/CL` → `CL=F` (WTI Crude Oil)
- `/ZN` → `ZN=F` (10-Year Treasury Note)
- `/GC` → `GC=F` (Gold)

**Admin panel note:** Ticker symbol stored with slash (e.g. `/CL`). The PUT/DELETE/lookup endpoints use `{symbol:path}` to allow slashes in URL paths.

**History fetch:** Schwab uses gap detection to determine what history to fetch per ticker — see Gap Detection section below. The merge logic in `_upsert` preserves existing long history when new data is shorter.

**Idempotency check:** Uses first Schwab-supported ticker (excludes `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED`) to avoid perpetual cache miss when a Yahoo-only ticker sorts first.

### Schwab API — Instrument Type Limitations (Architectural Decision)
Why certain tickers permanently route to Yahoo Finance — this is not a bug or a gap to close, it is a deliberate permanent architecture decision based on what the Schwab API actually supports.

- **Equities and ETFs:** Fully supported — `get_quotes()` (batch) + `get_price_history()` (per-ticker). Primary data source for all equity/ETF tickers.
- **Indices (SPX, NDX, $DJI, VIX, RUT, VVIX):** `SCHWAB_SYMBOL_MAP` translates these to Schwab format (`$SPX.X`, `$NDX.X`, etc.) but `get_quotes()` silently drops them — no error, just missing keys in the response. `get_price_history()` per-ticker may work but requires 6 separate HTTP calls vs. one Yahoo batch; the skip/append gap-detection path makes this near-zero cost on normal daily runs anyway. **Yahoo is the right permanent answer for indices.**
- **FX (USD = DXY index, JPY = USDJPY):** These are not securities — Schwab's API is equity/ETF-only and has no FX endpoint. DXY and spot FX rates simply do not exist in their quote infrastructure. **Yahoo is the right permanent answer for FX.**
- **Futures (/CL, /ZN, /GC):** Schwab uses contract-specific symbols (e.g. `/CLM26`). The "continuous front-month" concept used here (`CL=F`, `GC=F`) is a Yahoo abstraction — Yahoo handles the monthly roll automatically. Replicating that on Schwab would require tracking expiration calendars and rolling contracts, significant complexity for no signal quality gain at EOD resolution. **Yahoo is the right permanent answer for futures.**
- **Speed:** On skip/append days (the normal case after the first fetch), both Yahoo and Schwab are essentially instant due to gap detection. On bootstrap/short fetches Yahoo's batch call is faster than equivalent per-ticker Schwab calls. No speed advantage to switching.
- **Rule:** Do not attempt to replace Yahoo with Schwab for indices, FX, or futures — the mixed-source architecture is intentional and permanent. When adding new tickers in any of these categories, add them to `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED`, `YAHOO_SYMBOL_MAP`, and (if futures) `IV_INELIGIBLE`.

### SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED Expanded — Indices Now Route to Yahoo (`schwab_market_data.py`)
- Schwab batch quotes API silently drops index symbols (SPX, NDX, $DJI, VIX) when mixed with equity symbols — no error, just missing keys in the response
- Without this fix, these tickers never get `updated_at` stamped, causing REFRESH DATA to stay amber even after a successful refresh (SPX is `display_order=1` and its timestamp drives the header)
- **Fix:** Added `"SPX"`, `"NDX"`, `"$DJI"`, `"VIX"` to `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED` set — they always route to Yahoo Finance
- Full set: `{"USD", "JPY", "/CL", "/ZN", "/GC", "SPX", "NDX", "$DJI", "VIX", "RUT", "VVIX"}`
- **Idempotency fix:** When Schwab cache is fresh and early return fires, the code now still runs `_yahoo_fetch_subset` for the unsupported tickers — without this, SPX/VIX/etc. would never get their `updated_at` stamped on subsequent manual refreshes
- **RUT added 2026-04-10:** Russell 2000 Index — `YAHOO_SYMBOL_MAP["RUT"] = "^RUT"`, added to `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED` and `IV_INELIGIBLE`
- **VVIX added 2026-04-11:** CBOE VIX of VIX Index — `YAHOO_SYMBOL_MAP["VVIX"] = "^VVIX"`, added to `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED` and `IV_INELIGIBLE`

### Initial Page Load Indicator — `isInitialLoading` (`App.js`)
- On fresh page load, 4 parallel fetches fire; tickers resolve first, causing `ALL_DATA` to recompute with `generateMockData()` — shows fake sparklines, prices, and signal values
- Batch fetch (hitting Fly.io → Supabase) takes 20–30 seconds; during this window REFRESH DATA and CALCULATE SIGNALS showed misleadingly green/blue with no loading indication
- **Fix:** Added `isInitialLoading` state (starts `true`, set `false` in `.finally()` of the batch fetch)
- Both buttons grey and disabled during initial load; REFRESH DATA shows "⟳ LOADING..." text
- Loading banner "⟳ LOADING MARKET DATA..." appears above the table rows (shared with `isRefreshing` banner)
- "⚠ LIVE DATA UNAVAILABLE — DISPLAYING MOCK DATA" banner shows when batch returns empty after load completes

### Page Load vs REFRESH DATA — Separated Endpoints (`market_data.py`, `api.js`)
- **Root problem:** Page load and REFRESH DATA both called `/api/market-data/batch` → both triggered Schwab/Yahoo fetch → every navigation to Dashboard caused a 20-30s wait and made CALCULATE SIGNALS go amber
- **Fix:** Two separate endpoints with different responsibilities:
  - `GET /api/market-data/cached` — **page load only** — pure DB read, never calls Schwab or Yahoo; returns whatever is in `price_cache` right now; single `IN` query with `load_only` (no large JSON blobs loaded)
  - `GET /api/market-data/batch` — **REFRESH DATA button only** — triggers full Schwab/Yahoo fetch pipeline
- `fetchCachedMarketData()` in `api.js` calls `/cached` — used in page load `useEffect`
- `fetchBatchMarketData()` in `api.js` calls `/batch` — used by REFRESH DATA button handler only
- **Rule:** Never call `/batch` on page load or navigation — it always triggers external API calls

### React Router SPA Navigation (`App.js`, `AdminPanel.js`)
- **Root problem:** Routing used `window.location.pathname` check — admin → dashboard was a full page reload, destroying all React state and re-firing all 5 API calls every navigation
- **Fix:** `react-router-dom` v7 installed; `App` now uses `<BrowserRouter><Routes><Route>` — navigation is an SPA transition, no page reload, no white flash
- `AdminPanel` uses `useNavigate()` hook; `← DASHBOARD` button calls `navigate("/")` instead of `window.location.href = "/"`
- Dashboard still remounts on navigation (Routes unmounts inactive routes) but with `/cached` the re-fetch is instant (pure DB read)
- nginx `try_files` config already handles SPA routing in production — no nginx changes needed

### Global Header (`src/components/shared/Header.js`)
- Fixed top bar: `position: fixed, top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, height: 48px, zIndex: 200`
- Background matches sidebar: `#060e1a`, border-bottom `1px solid #1a2a3a`
- **Left side — brand:** 4px gradient bar (`#00e5a0` → `#0077ff`) + "SIGNAL MATRIX" (11px, 700, `#e8f4ff`, 0.2em tracking) + "MULTI-TIMEFRAME · PROBABILISTIC" subtitle (9px, `#445566`)
- **Right side — user profile placeholder:** 30px circle button with SVG person icon; future home for CALCULATE SIGNALS, REFRESH DATA, and real user profile
- `zIndex: 200` — above sidebar (`zIndex: 100`) so header always covers the sidebar top edge
- **Future:** CALCULATE SIGNALS and REFRESH DATA buttons will migrate here from the dashboard header; user profile will link to settings

### Left Sidebar Navigation (`src/components/shared/Sidebar.js`)
- Collapsible icon rail: **48px collapsed** (icon only), **180px expanded** (icon + label) on `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`; `transition: width 200ms ease`
- `position: fixed`, `top: 48px` (below global header), `height: calc(100vh - 48px)` — `position: fixed` eliminates ResizeObserver stutter caused by Recharts `ResponsiveContainer` firing during flex-layout width changes
- Active item: `3px solid #00e5a0` left border + `rgba(0,229,160,0.07)` background; detected via `useLocation()` (exact match for `/`, prefix for sub-routes)
- **Lock toggle** at bottom: click to lock sidebar open or return to hover mode; icon-only (no text label), tooltip = "Collapse Sidebar" / "Expand Sidebar"; green lock icon when locked, grey when unlocked
- `locked` and `onToggleLock` props — `sidebarLocked` state lives in `AppLayout`; `expanded = locked || hovered`; mouse enter/leave events disabled when locked
- **NAV_ITEMS array** in `Sidebar.js` is the single place to add future dashboards — each entry is `{ icon, label, path, exact }`
- **Admin is NOT in the sidebar** — admin remains accessible only by direct URL (`/admin`); settings gear icon (deferred) will be the future password gate
- **AppLayout pattern in `App.js`:** `App` renders `<BrowserRouter><AppLayout />` — `AppLayout` renders `<Header />` first (fixed), then a flex container with `paddingTop: 48`; `sidebarWidth = locked ? 180 : 48`; content div uses `marginLeft: sidebarWidth` with matching transition
- **Routes defined:**
  - `/ticker/:symbol` → `TickerAnalysis` stub (future ticker drill-down analysis page)
  - `/vol` → `SpxVolChart`
  - `/vol/macro` → `MacroVolChart`
  - `/spx-impact` → `SpxImpactDashboard`
  - `/sector` → `SectorPerformance`
  - `/admin` → `AdminPanel` (no sidebar)
  - `*` → `Dashboard` (catch-all)
- **Rule:** Add new dashboards by appending to `NAV_ITEMS` in `Sidebar.js` — no other files need changing for basic nav items
- **Rule:** Sidebar must remain `position: fixed` — reverting to `position: sticky` re-introduces ResizeObserver stutter on any page with Recharts `ResponsiveContainer`

### SPX Vol Chart (`src/components/Vol/SpxVolChart.js`)
- Route: `/vol` (registered as `/vol/*` in AppLayout)
- **Data:** `fetchSpxVolHistory()` → `/api/signals/spx-vol-history` — returns `{ dates, hv30, hv90, pct_change, updated }`
- **Chart:** Recharts `ComposedChart` — HV30 (blue line, left axis), HV90 (orange line, left axis), daily % change (green/red bars, right axis)
- **X-axis:** Year labels only — `getJanTicks(dates)` pre-filters to first Jan date per year, passed as explicit `ticks` prop; eliminates grey phantom tick marks from null-returning custom tick components
- **Right Y-axis:** Symmetric domain callback `([dataMin, dataMax]) => [-bound, bound]` where `bound = ceil(max(|dataMin|, |dataMax|) × 10) / 10` — ensures zero-centered bar chart
- **2Y/MAX toggle:** Default 2Y; `useMemo` filters data by ISO date string comparison; toggle buttons styled with active border/background matching dashboard aesthetic
- **Layout:** 75px horizontal padding on both sides; chart area has `border: 1px solid #1a2a3a`, `borderRadius: 6`, `background: #07111f`
- **`position: fixed` sidebar fix:** Sidebar stutter on this page was caused by Recharts `ResponsiveContainer` ResizeObserver firing as the flex-layout content width changed during hover transitions. Fixed by making sidebar `position: fixed` — content width never changes.

### Macro Volatility Dashboard (`src/components/Vol/MacroVolChart.js`)
- Route: `/vol/macro` — sidebar nav item "MACRO VOL" with dual-wave SVG icon (`MacroVolIcon`)
- **Data:** `fetchMacroVolHistory()` → `GET /api/vol/macro-history` — returns `{ dates, series, stats, updated }`
- **Tickers displayed:** VIX, VXN (NazVol), RVX, GVZ, OVX — 5 series on chart and stats table. MOVE is collected in the data pipeline (SCHWAB_INDEX_HISTORY_MAP) and stored in price_cache but intentionally excluded from this dashboard — reserved for the future Fixed Income dashboard.
- **Chart:** Recharts `ComposedChart` — VIX/VXN/RVX/GVZ on left Y-axis; OVX on right Y-axis (crude oil vol — higher scale). 2Y/MAX toggle. Dynamic filtering: tickers with no API data are excluded automatically.
- **Stats table:** Last · Prior Day · 1 Wk Ago · 1 Mo Ago · 3 Mo Ago · DoD (Δ bps / %Δ) · WoW · MoM. Vol up = red, vol down = green. MOVE row tagged with "bond" badge. Header labels (DoD/WoW/MoM) are on the Δ bps column (not colspan=2).
- **Date alignment:** `common_dates` = set intersection of all 6 tickers' date arrays. DoD stats anchored to `common_dates[-1]` / `common_dates[-2]` — avoids 0-delta artifact when Schwab includes weekend bars for some tickers.
- **Backend:** `GET /api/vol/macro-history` in `backend/routers/vol.py`
  - Queries `price_cache` for `_MACRO_VOL_TICKERS = ["VIX", "VXN", "RVX", "GVZ", "OVX", "MOVE"]`
  - Intersects date sets; builds `series {ticker: [close, ...]}` and `stats {ticker: {...}}` aligned to intersection
  - Stats use `bisect.bisect_right` for historical lookups (1d/1w/1m/3m)

### Macro Vol — Data Source Architecture
- **VIX:** Yahoo Finance (`^VIX`) — in `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED`, not in `SCHWAB_INDEX_HISTORY_MAP`
- **VXN, RVX, GVZ, OVX, MOVE:** Schwab `get_price_history()` using `$-prefix` symbols (`$VXN`, `$RVX`, `$GVZ`, `$OVX`, `$MOVE`) — defined in `SCHWAB_INDEX_HISTORY_MAP` in `schwab_market_data.py`
  - These stay in `SCHWAB_UNSUPPORTED` (batch quotes don't work for them) but are fetched via `_schwab_fetch_index_histories()`
  - Called from the tail of `_schwab_fetch()` after splitting `unsupported` into `yahoo_only` vs `schwab_index`
- **Gap detection modes for index history tickers:**
  - `skip`: no-op (cache_date == today)
  - `append` (1–5 day gap): 10-day DAY period fetch → `_append_bar` last candle (fast, avoids buggy 1-month endpoint)
  - `short` (6–45 day gap) / `bootstrap`: 5-year YEAR period fetch → full `_upsert` with merge (reliable; 1-month endpoint mis-scales MOVE values)
- **Yahoo fallback protection:** `_yahoo_fallback()` excludes `SCHWAB_INDEX_HISTORY_MAP` tickers entirely. When Schwab tokens expire, these tickers keep stale Schwab data rather than being overwritten with Yahoo garbage (Yahoo returns ~73 stale bars for `^RVX` starting from the same date as existing history, causing `_upsert` merge `cut=0` → full history replaced)
- **`YAHOO_SYMBOL_MAP`** still has entries for VXN/RVX/GVZ/OVX/MOVE (`^VXN` etc.) — used only for intraday Yahoo quotes, not EOD history
- **`IV_INELIGIBLE` and `_HV_ONLY_TICKERS`** in `schwab_options.py` include all 5 tickers — no options chain fetch; HV30/HV90 accumulated via `accumulate_hv_only()`
- **Production bootstrap:** After first deploy or after RVX/MOVE data corruption, clear the row and re-run `_schwab_fetch_index_histories(db, list(SCHWAB_INDEX_HISTORY_MAP.keys()), client)` directly in Python

### Sector Performance Dashboard (`src/components/Macro/SectorPerformance.js`)
- Route: `/sector` — sidebar nav item "SECTOR PERF" with pie-sector icon
- **Data:** `apiFetch("/api/sector-performance")` → `{ absolute, relative, labels, as_of }`
- **Two tables stacked vertically:**
  1. **Sector Performance** — 11 sector ETFs + S&P 500 (SPX bolded, double-border separator at top)
  2. **Sector Relative Performance** — same 11 sectors, % change minus SPX for each period; no SPX row
- **Columns:** SECTOR | TICKER | PRICE | 1-DAY % | MTD % | QTD % | YTD %
- **Sub-labels** on period columns: e.g. "May 2026" under MTD %, "Q2 2026" under QTD %, "2026" under YTD %
- **Cell coloring:** positive → `rgba(0,229,160,0.13)` bg + `#00e5a0` text; negative → `rgba(255,77,109,0.13)` bg + `#ff4d6d` text; null → transparent + grey dash
- **Header:** title left, "SIGNAL MATRIX / EOD · {date}" right — same layout on both tables
- **Layout:** `padding: "28px 164px"` — matches SPX Impact page cushion
- **Backend:** `GET /api/sector-performance` in `backend/routers/sector_performance.py`
  - Reads `history_json` + `history_dates_json` from `price_cache` for all 12 tickers (single `IN` query + `load_only`)
  - Uses `bisect_left` on the date array to find period-start prices: last close strictly before YTD/QTD/MTD start dates; `prices[-2]` for 1-day prior
  - Relative = sector % − SPX % for each period column
  - Returns `labels` dict `{ mtd, qtd, ytd }` with human-readable strings and `as_of` date string
- **Sector ticker list (hardcoded in router):** XLY, XLF, XLV, XLK, XLP, XLI, XLB, XLE, XLU, XLRE, XLC, SPX
- **Rule:** SPX price displayed without `$` prefix (index, not a dollar price); all sector ETFs display with `$` prefix

### Ticker Analysis Page — Stub (`src/components/Analysis/TickerAnalysis.js`)
- Route: `/ticker/:symbol` — reads symbol from `useParams()`
- Has a ticker input form: submit navigates to `/ticker/{SYMBOL}` (uppercased, trimmed)
- Placeholder "COMING SOON" body — full charts/IV/structure/regime content is future scope
- Sidebar is present (rendered by AppLayout for all non-admin routes)
- **Rule:** Dashboard row-click behavior is unchanged (popup still fires) — when the full analysis page is built, wire it by replacing the row-click handler in `App.js`

### N+1 Query Fix — Batch Read Path (`market_data.py`)
- **Root problem:** `refresh_data()` read cache results with a per-ticker loop: `for ticker in tickers: db.query(PriceCache).filter(ticker == t).first()` — 51 round trips to Supabase to build a single page load response
- **Fix:** Single `IN` query with `load_only` — fetches only the columns needed for `serialize_cache_row`, skips `history_json` and `volume_history_json` blobs (252-756 data points each, never used in page load response)
- Same pattern applied in the new `/cached` endpoint
- **Rule:** Never re-introduce per-ticker query loops in read paths — always use `.filter(PriceCache.ticker.in_(tickers))`

### Gap Detection — Incremental History Fetch (`schwab_market_data.py`)
- **Root problem:** Every REFRESH DATA call fetched 3 months of history per ticker from Schwab, even though the DB already had the full history and only 1 new bar was needed
- **Fix:** `_history_fetch_mode(existing_row, today_str)` determines what to fetch per ticker:
  ```
  "skip"      — last stored date == today → update quote fields only (no history change)
  "append"    — gap 1-5 calendar days (normal day, weekend, holiday) → append today's bar from batch quote, no Schwab history API call
  "short"     — gap 6-45 calendar days → 1-month targeted fetch (covers short outages)
  "bootstrap" — no history, < 252 bars, or gap > 45 days → full 5-year fetch
  ```
- `_append_bar()` — appends close/volume from batch quote to existing `history_json`; recomputes MA20/50/100/200, STD20, spark from merged history; no API call
- `_update_quote_only()` — updates close/volume/timestamp only when history already contains today
- Pre-load all existing cache rows before the ticker loop (one `IN` query) — eliminates another N+1 inside `_schwab_fetch`
- `time.sleep(0.5)` rate-limit guard only executes when a Schwab history API call is actually made — not on skip/append paths
- **Normal daily result (Schwab tickers):** 1 batch quote call (all tickers) + 0 per-ticker history calls → completes in seconds
- **New ticker result:** bootstrap path fires automatically — no special handling needed; existing tickers are unaffected

### Gap Detection — Yahoo-Only Tickers (`schwab_market_data.py`, `yahoo_finance.py`)
- **Root problem:** `_yahoo_fetch_subset` had no cache awareness — fetched full 5-year history from Yahoo for every Yahoo-only ticker (SPX, NDX, VIX, RUT, USD, JPY, /CL, /ZN, /GC, $DJI) on every REFRESH DATA call. Second hit of the day: ~66 seconds.
- **Fix:** Same four-mode gap detection applied to the Yahoo path:
  - `skip` — cache_date == today → no-op; second hit of the day is now instant for all Yahoo tickers
  - `append` — gap 1-5 days → `fetch_ticker_close()` (5-day fetch, returns close+volume only) + `_append_bar()`; avoids full 5-year pull on normal daily runs
  - `short` / `bootstrap` — full `fetch_ticker_data()` (5-year fetch) as before
- `fetch_ticker_close(ticker)` added to `yahoo_finance.py` — uses `yf.Ticker().history(period="5d")`, returns `(close, volume)` tuple; fast, no history processing
- Pre-load all existing rows before Yahoo loop (one `IN` query) — same N+1 fix as Schwab path
- **Result:** Second REFRESH DATA same day → instant (all skip). Normal daily first hit → ~10s instead of ~60s (lightweight 5d fetch × 10 tickers)

### CALCULATE SIGNALS — Hurst + Pivots Skip on Repeat Manual Runs (`signals.py`)
- **Root problem:** Manual CALCULATE SIGNALS mid-day recomputed Hurst (~130s) + Pivots (~40s) every press, even though both are EOD-only calculations that don't change until new price data arrives
- **Fix:** `calculate_signals()` checks `calculated_at` date against today ET for both `SignalHurst` and `SignalPivots` before running. If already computed today and `trigger == "manual"`, stage is skipped
- **Scheduler path unchanged:** `trigger="scheduled"` always runs full pipeline — Hurst + Pivots always recompute at 4 PM EOD
- **First manual press of the day:** full pipeline (~263s for 95 tickers) — unavoidable, Hurst hasn't run yet
- **Subsequent manual presses same day:** only output stage runs (~76s) — Hurst + Pivots skipped
- **Rule:** Never apply this skip to `trigger="scheduled"` — EOD run must always recompute everything with fresh price data

### IV Fetch — Idempotent on Manual REFRESH DATA (`market_data.py`, `schwab_options.py`)
- **Root problem:** `market_data.py` called `schwab_fetch_iv(db, force=True)` — bypassed the built-in idempotency check on every manual REFRESH DATA press, running ~65 Schwab options chain calls (~55 seconds) even when IV was already fresh
- **Fix:** Changed to `schwab_fetch_iv(db, force=False)` — the existing idempotency check now fires: if IV already fetched today, skip entirely
- **Scheduler path unchanged:** Scheduler calls `schwab_fetch_iv(db)` (default `force=False`) — since IV has never been fetched when the 4 PM job runs, the idempotency check never fires and IV always fetches fresh at EOD
- **First manual REFRESH DATA of the day:** IV fetches (~55 seconds) — unavoidable, 65 options chain calls
- **Subsequent REFRESH DATA same day:** IV skipped entirely → near-instant
- **Rule:** Never change back to `force=True` in `market_data.py` — it re-introduces the 55-second penalty on every button press

### Intraday Price Refresh — `schwab_fetch_intraday_quotes` vs `schwab_fetch_all` (`schwab_market_data.py`)
- **Root problem:** The intraday monitor originally called `schwab_fetch_all(db)` for price updates. `schwab_fetch_all()` has an idempotency check that returns early once `cache_date == today AND data_source == "schwab"` — meaning after the first intraday call, every subsequent 15-minute call would skip `get_quotes()` entirely and `price_cache.close` would stay frozen at the first read value.
- **Fix:** Added `schwab_fetch_intraday_quotes(db)` — a dedicated lightweight function for intraday use only:
  - No idempotency check — always calls `get_quotes()` every time it is invoked
  - Uses `lastPrice` exclusively — never falls back to `closePrice` (which is yesterday's EOD)
  - Does NOT update `cache_date` — preserves the EOD idempotency check for `schwab_fetch_all()`
  - Updates `close`, `volume`, `daily_high`, `daily_low`, and `updated_at` only
- **Rule:** The intraday monitor must ALWAYS use `schwab_fetch_intraday_quotes(db)` — never `schwab_fetch_all(db)`. Using `schwab_fetch_all` intraday silently freezes prices after the first call.

### Live Dot Removed from Header (`App.js`)
- The `● LIVE` dot in the dashboard header was removed — it added no signal value and confused users about data freshness
- SCHED indicator, EOD timestamp, and button colors already communicate all relevant freshness state

### Button Freshness Indicators — REFRESH DATA / CALCULATE SIGNALS
Buttons change color to communicate data/signal state — no separate status dots needed:
- **REFRESH DATA**: green = data is current; **amber** = past 4:15 PM ET on a weekday AND cache is from a prior day
  - Before 4:15 PM ET: always green — yesterday's EOD close IS the freshest data available (market hasn't closed)
  - Weekends: always green — Friday's close is correct, no trading
  - After 4:15 PM ET on a weekday with stale cache: amber (scheduler should have run)
- **CALCULATE SIGNALS**: blue = signals current; **amber** = signals timestamp is older than data timestamp (full timestamp comparison, not date-only)
  - Same-day staleness is now caught — if data refreshed at 10 PM but signals last ran at 8 PM, button goes amber
- Both go grey with "⟳ LOADING..." text while running; REFRESH DATA also shows "⟳ LOADING..." during initial page load
- `calculated_at` exposed in `/api/signals/stored` response for freshness comparison
- Freshness logic lives in the button render block in `App.js`
- **Admin-only:** both buttons are hidden for non-admin users (`isAdmin` check in App.js); backend endpoints `/api/market-data/batch` and `/api/signals/calculate` enforce the same with `require_admin_user`

### Auth & User Management — JWT Cookie + RBAC ✅
- Replaced `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (shared client-side gate) with full session-auth layer
- JWT in httpOnly cookie (`sm_session`), 12-hour expiry, `samesite="lax"`, `secure=IS_PRODUCTION`
- Two new tables: `users`, `password_reset_tokens` (UUID primary keys; SQLAlchemy stores as TEXT in SQLite, native UUID in Postgres)
- Two new routers: `routers/auth.py` (renamed existing `router` → `schwab_router`, added new JWT auth `router`) and `routers/users.py` (admin-only user CRUD)
- New service: `services/auth_service.py` — bcrypt hashing, JWT encode/decode, password strength validation, reset tokens, `seed_admin_if_empty`, `require_admin_user` dependency
- Self-registration → `pending` state → admin approval → `active` flow
- Password reset via email link; 15-minute token TTL; reset-tokens are one-shot (consume marks `used=True`)
- Admin Users tab at `/admin/users` (UserList.js): list / activate / disable / change role / reset password (admin-side, no email)
- Self-protection guards in admin endpoints: cannot disable own account, cannot demote self from admin
- Session middleware in `main.py` checks cookie → user → status on every request; `PUBLIC_PATHS` set covers auth endpoints + Schwab OAuth callback + `/health` + `/`
- slowapi rate limits: register 3/hour, login 5/5min, forgot-password 3/hour, reset-password 5/hour
- Recovery: `backend/scripts/reset_admin.py` (idempotent — creates or resets admin from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars). Run via `fly ssh console --app signal-matrix-api -C "python -m scripts.reset_admin"`. Documented in `Docs/RUNBOOK_AUTH_RECOVERY.md`.
- `Base.metadata.create_all()` in `main.py` creates auth tables at startup; alembic migrations are guarded with `if "table_name" not in inspector.get_table_names()` so `alembic upgrade head` post-deploy is idempotent and just stamps the version table.
- New env vars: `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_DISPLAY_NAME`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `APP_BASE_URL` (defaults to `https://signal.suttonmc.com`; local `.env` sets to `http://localhost:3000` for email-link clickthrough during dev).
- Removed env var: `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (and accompanying `Dockerfile.web.fly` build arg, `deploy-web.sh` plumbing).
- Logout clears cookie only; JWT remains valid until natural expiry. To force-revoke a session, set `users.status = "disabled"` — middleware blocks every subsequent request from that user.
- Frontend: `AuthProvider` (top-level wrapper in `App.js`), `apiFetch` (in `services/api.js`; auto-redirects to `/login` on 401), `ProtectedRoute` (in `components/shared/ProtectedRoute.js`; supports `requireAdmin` prop). Header dropdown displays "Signed in as / email / role badge" + admin panel link (admin only) + sign out.
- See `Docs/Auth_User_Management_Spec_v1.0.md` for full spec including deferred decisions (token blocklist, useApiFetch hook, Cloudflare WAF rate limiting).

### New Button — CALCULATE SIGNALS
- Added to dashboard header alongside REFRESH DATA
- Manual trigger only — never auto-calculates on page load
- Must be run AFTER REFRESH DATA (price history must be current)
- Calls: `GET /api/signals/calculate` — runs full pipeline (hurst → pivots → output → snapshot) in one call
- Signal engine reads from `price_cache` SQLite table — NEVER calls yfinance directly

---

## Phase 4 — Task 4.2: EOD Scheduler ✅

### Scheduler Overview
- APScheduler `AsyncIOScheduler` inside FastAPI lifespan
- **Three registered jobs:**
  1. `schwab_data_job` — CronTrigger 4:00 PM ET NYSE trading days (prices → IV → signals)
  2. `schwab_refresh` — interval every 25 min (proactive Schwab token refresh)
  3. `intraday_monitor` — CronTrigger mon–fri 9:30 AM–3:45 PM ET at :00/:15/:30/:45
- On startup: catch-up check — if past 4:00 PM ET, trading day, and no successful run today → runs immediately
- All dates use **ET timezone** — never UTC (see UTC vs ET fix above)
- **Five registered jobs:** `schwab_data_job` (4 PM EOD), `schwab_refresh` (25 min interval), `intraday_monitor` (15 min market hours), `spx_impact_11am` (11 AM ET Mon-Fri), `spx_impact_1pm` (1 PM ET Mon-Fri)

### EOD Flow (4:00 PM ET, NYSE trading days) — single chained job
```
APScheduler (schwab_data_job)
    → schwab_fetch_all()                writes → price_cache (Schwab primary, Yahoo fallback)
    → schwab_fetch_iv()                 writes → price_cache.rel_iv + vol_history (IV-eligible tickers)
    → accumulate_hv_only()              writes → vol_history hv30/hv90 (Yahoo-only: SPX, NDX, RUT, VIX, $DJI, USD, JPY, futures, VVIX)
    → calculate_signals()               writes → signal_hurst / signal_pivots / signal_output / signal_history
    → compute_and_cache_spx_impact()    writes → spx_impact_cache (label='eod') — non-fatal step 4
    → scheduler_log                     writes → success/failure entry
```
Previously two separate jobs (data at 4:00 PM, signals at 4:15 PM). Merged into one — signals run
immediately after data fetch, both buttons go green together by ~4:02 PM.

### Intraday SPX Impact Snapshots (11 AM + 1 PM ET, Mon-Fri)
```
APScheduler (spx_impact_11am / spx_impact_1pm)
    → Read weights_json from most recent EOD row in spx_impact_cache — no IVV fetch
    → _batch_schwab_quotes()    3 calls × 200-ticker chunks (~5 seconds total)
    → _compute_impacts()        no AH strip (lastPrice is live intraday)
    → Upsert spx_impact_cache   label='11am' or '1pm', computed_date=today_et
```
- Non-fatal per-job (each job is standalone, not chained to EOD)
- Idempotent: re-run same day overwrites the existing intraday row
- Trading day guard: `_is_trading_day()` check inside job — no-op on holidays/weekends

### Page Load Flow
```
App.js useEffect (Task 4.5)
    → /api/market-data/batch    reads price_cache   → close, sparklines, rel IV
    → /api/signals/stored       reads signal_output → viewpoint, conviction, LRR/HRR
    → /api/scheduler/status     reads scheduler_log → ● SCHED indicator
```

### Manual Override Buttons
```
REFRESH DATA        → force Yahoo fetch outside scheduler window
CALCULATE SIGNALS   → force recalculation mid-day or after code change
```

### Edge Case Coverage
```
Docker down at 4:00 PM → startup catchup fires on restart if past 4:00 ET and today's job missing
PC off at 4:00 PM      → same catchup pattern covers this
Run twice same day     → signal_history idempotency check prevents duplicate snapshots
429 from Yahoo         → stale cache served, scheduler_log records failure
```

### Scheduler Files
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `backend/services/scheduler.py` | Core job logic, catch-up, start/shutdown; all three jobs |
| `backend/routers/scheduler.py` | `GET /api/scheduler/status` endpoint |
| `backend/models/scheduler_log.py` | SQLAlchemy model for `scheduler_log` table |
| `backend/services/intraday_monitor.py` | PROXIMITY + RETRACEMENT_50 alert engine |
| `backend/services/sms.py` | Twilio SMS wrapper |
| `backend/models/intraday_alert_log.py` | Alert dedup log model |

### scheduler_log Table
```sql
id, run_date (ET), trigger ('scheduled'|'catchup'|'manual'),
status ('success'|'failure'), refresh_ok, signals_ok,
error_msg, duration_s, created_at (UTC string)
```

### Dashboard Header — Scheduler Indicator
`● SCHED` dot next to data timestamp:
- **Green** — today's EOD run complete (`today_complete = true`)
- **Amber** — scheduled, not yet run today
- **Red** — last run failed
- Hover tooltip shows run time or next scheduled time. Fetched once on page load, no polling.

### Refactors Made for Scheduler
- `refresh_data(db)` extracted from `get_batch` endpoint in `market_data.py` — callable directly
- `run_hurst(db)`, `run_pivots(db)`, `run_output(db)`, `calculate_signals(db)` extracted in `signals.py`
- HTTP endpoints now call these functions — behavior unchanged
- `main.py` converted from module-level startup to `lifespan` context manager

## Intraday Monitor — PROXIMITY + RETRACEMENT_50 SMS Alerts ✅

### Overview
Lightweight price monitor running every 15 minutes during NYSE trading hours (9:30 AM–3:45 PM ET).
Does NOT recalculate pivots, Hurst, or conviction. Reads EOD-calculated signal state and watches
live price against it. Fires SMS alerts via Twilio when triggers are met.

**Critical design constraint:** Never call `calculate_signals()` intraday — pivot states require
confirmed EOD closes. Running signals intraday would produce false BREAK_OF_TRADE states.
The monitor is purely observational.

### Two Triggers (each fires at most once per ticker per day)

**PROXIMITY** — `prox >= 0.85` toward entry zone:
```
Bullish: prox = 1 - (close - lrr) / (hrr - lrr)   peaks at 1.0 when close = LRR
Bearish: prox = (close - lrr) / (hrr - lrr)         peaks at 1.0 when close = HRR
Not clamped — price below LRR (Bullish) reports as 110%+ etc.
```
- Fires once per ticker per day (first time prox >= 0.85)
- SMS: ticker, viewpoint, price, entry level, prox %, range, conviction

**RETRACEMENT_50** — price retraces 50% from D back toward C (pullback entry):
```
Gate: structural_state must be UPTREND_VALID or DOWNTREND_VALID
Uptrend:   d_eff = max(pivot_d, close)          # intraday D may extend higher
           level_50 = pivot_c + 0.50 × (d_eff - pivot_c)
           fires when close <= level_50
Downtrend: d_eff = min(pivot_d, close)          # intraday D may extend lower
           level_50 = d_eff + 0.50 × (pivot_c - d_eff)
           fires when close >= level_50
```
- Dedup key includes `pivot_c` — new C = new setup = alert resets for same ticker same day
- SMS: ticker, viewpoint, price, D level, C pivot, 50% level, conviction

### Scheduler — CronTrigger (clock-aligned)
```python
CronTrigger(
    day_of_week = "mon-fri",
    hour        = "9-15",
    minute      = "0,15,30,45",
    timezone    = "America/New_York",
)
```
- Fires at :00/:15/:30/:45 aligned to clock — NOT relative to container start time
- `hour="9-15"` includes 9:00 and 9:15; pre-market guard skips those: `if now_et.hour == 9 and now_et.minute < 30: return`
- Effective window: 9:30 AM, 9:45 AM, 10:00 AM … 3:30 PM, 3:45 PM ET
- NYSE trading days only (via `_is_trading_day()` check inside the job)
- **Rule:** Never switch back to `"interval", minutes=15` — interval fires relative to container start and will miss the 9:30 AM open

### Per-Run Flow (`run_intraday_check(db)`)
```
1. schwab_fetch_intraday_quotes(db)      — fast batch quotes, lastPrice only, no cache_date update
2. Load signal_output                    — trade tf, non-Neutral viewpoints only (read-only)
3. Load signal_pivots                    — trade tf, matching tickers (read-only)
4. Load price_cache                      — current close after step 1
5. For each ticker:
   a. PROXIMITY check → send SMS + log if prox >= 0.85 and not already fired today
   b. RETRACEMENT_50 check → send SMS + log if at/past 50% level and not already fired today
6. db.commit()
```

### intraday_alert_log Table
```sql
id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
ticker      TEXT NOT NULL (index)
alert_date  TEXT NOT NULL                -- ET YYYY-MM-DD
alert_type  TEXT NOT NULL                -- 'PROXIMITY' | 'RETRACEMENT_50'
pivot_c     FLOAT nullable               -- dedup key for retracement (NULL for PROXIMITY)
fired_at    TEXT NOT NULL                -- ET HH:MM
price       FLOAT NOT NULL
metric      FLOAT nullable               -- prox% or retrace% (e.g. 0.88 or 0.50)
conviction  FLOAT nullable
created_at  TEXT NOT NULL                -- UTC timestamp

UNIQUE(ticker, alert_date, alert_type, pivot_c)
```
**Postgres NULL caveat:** `UNIQUE` with a nullable column does NOT prevent duplicate NULL rows in
Postgres (NULL != NULL). For PROXIMITY alerts (`pivot_c = NULL`) the Python `_already_fired()`
check is the primary dedup guard. The constraint only guarantees uniqueness for RETRACEMENT_50
rows (where `pivot_c` is set).

### SMS Service (`sms.py`)
- `send_sms(message)` → True/False
- Reads from env: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM`, `TWILIO_TO`
- No-ops silently (with warning log) if any credential is missing — safe in dev without Twilio configured
- Lazy import of `twilio.rest.Client` — won't crash on import if twilio package issue

### Why Volume Surge Was Excluded
The first 15-minute bar always has elevated volume relative to the daily average (opening spike) —
any volume pace comparison in the first 1–2 bars would fire false positives on nearly every ticker.
Dropped entirely. OBV direction already computed in EOD signals and displayed in the popup.

---

## Phase 4 — Task 4.3: Signal History Daily Snapshots ✅

### Overview
- Every time `calculate_signals()` runs (manual or scheduled), a snapshot of all `signal_output` rows is written to `signal_history`
- Idempotent — one snapshot per ticker/timeframe per ET calendar day; re-runs same day are skipped
- Trigger string (`"manual"`, `"scheduled"`, `"catchup"`) recorded per snapshot

### signal_history Table
```sql
id, snapshot_date (ET YYYY-MM-DD), trigger, ticker, timeframe,
lrr, hrr, structural_state, trade_direction, conviction, h_value,
viewpoint, alert, vol_signal, warning, lrr_warn, hrr_warn,
pivot_b, pivot_c, calculated_at (copied from signal_output), created_at (UTC)

INDEX: (snapshot_date, ticker)
No UNIQUE constraint — idempotency enforced in Python, not DB
```

### Snapshot Logic (`snapshot_signals` in `signals.py`)
- Called inside `calculate_signals()` after output is written — failure is non-fatal (logged, not raised)
- Checks for existing row with same `snapshot_date` + `ticker` + `timeframe` before inserting
- `snapshot_date` uses ET timezone — `datetime.now(ZoneInfo("America/New_York")).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`

### History API Endpoint
`GET /api/signals/history` — query params: `ticker`, `timeframe`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `limit` (default 30, max 500)
- Returns rows newest-first
- Not currently wired to dashboard UI — available for future analysis and backtesting

### CALCULATE SIGNALS Button
- Frontend calls `GET /api/signals/calculate` — runs full pipeline + snapshot in one call
- After `/calculate` completes, frontend immediately fetches `GET /api/signals/stored` to populate React state
- **Critical:** `/calculate` response only contains raw `compute_output` data — it does NOT include `h_trade_delta`, `vix_regime`, or other fields written separately during the signal loop. Always use `/stored` as the source of truth for React state after calculation.

---

## Phase 4 — Task 4.5: Auto-Load Cache on Page Load ✅

### Overview
- `App.js` calls `/api/market-data/batch` on mount via `useEffect` — populates close prices, sparklines, rel IV from SQLite cache
- Cache is always warm from scheduler — page load is instant, no Yahoo Finance call
- REFRESH DATA button retained as manual override to force a fresh Yahoo fetch
- Signals also auto-load from `/api/signals/stored` on page load (Task 3.4, unchanged)

### Rule Clarification
- Auto-loading from **SQLite cache** on page load is allowed — this is a local DB read
- Auto-fetching from **Yahoo Finance** on page load is still prohibited
- The distinction: cache read = instant + safe; Yahoo fetch = external call + rate limit risk

---

## Phase 4 — Task 4.6: Tickers Table + Dynamic Backend ✅

### Overview
- SQLite `tickers` table is the source of truth — replaces `tickers.js` + localStorage
- `tickers.js` retained as seed-only bootstrap file — never modified directly
- `seed_tickers_if_empty(db)` runs on FastAPI startup — inserts 52 rows if table is empty
  (AMZN excluded from Tier 2 seed due to UNIQUE constraint — add via admin panel if needed)
- `market_data.py` and `signals.py` both call `get_active_tickers(db)` — no hardcoded lists
- `App.js` fetches ticker universe from `GET /api/tickers?active=true` on mount

### Tickers Table Schema
```sql
id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
ticker        TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
description   TEXT
asset_class   TEXT
sector        TEXT
tier          INTEGER DEFAULT 1
parent_ticker TEXT
active        BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
display_order INTEGER
created_at    TEXT    -- UTC timestamp
updated_at    TEXT    -- UTC timestamp
```

### Tickers API Endpoints
```
GET    /api/tickers              ← list all (active filter optional; admin fetches all)
POST   /api/tickers              ← create new ticker (409 if exists)
PUT    /api/tickers/{symbol}     ← update any field
DELETE /api/tickers/{symbol}     ← soft-delete (active=false) — never hard-delete
GET    /api/tickers/lookup/{sym} ← Task 4.7: yfinance suggestions (registered BEFORE /{symbol})
```

### Field Mapping
| DB / API | React state | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ticker` | `ticker` | Locked after creation |
| `description` | `description` | |
| `asset_class` | `assetClass` | |
| `sector` | `sector` | |
| `tier` | `tier` | 1 or 2 |
| `parent_ticker` | `parentTicker` | Tier 2 only |
| `active` | `active` | Soft-delete flag |
| `display_order` | `displayOrder` | |

### Admin Panel UX (Task 4.6/4.7)
- Add ticker: click `+ ADD TICKER` → type symbol → optionally click `LOOK UP` → edit cells → click `SAVE` (or Enter)
- Lookup pre-fills empty fields only — never overwrites existing values
- `_isNew` local flag: row posts on SAVE; existing rows PUT on any cell commit
- `newTickerValues` state tracks keystroke input independently to prevent focus loss on re-render
- Ticker cell locked (disabled) after row is saved — symbol cannot be changed
- Deactivate: soft-delete via DELETE API; Reactivate: PUT with `active: true`
- Asset Class field is a dropdown — enforces exact vocabulary, not free text

---

## Phase 4 — Task 4.7: yfinance Lookup Endpoint ✅

### Overview
- `GET /api/tickers/lookup/{symbol}` — on-demand metadata fetch for new tickers
- Returns suggested description, asset class, sector — never auto-saves
- User reviews and corrects suggestions before saving via admin panel

### Response Schema
```json
{
  "symbol": "EWG",
  "found": true,
  "suggestions": {
    "description": "iShares MSCI Germany ETF",
    "asset_class": "International Equities",
    "sector": "Germany"
  },
  "already_exists": false,
  "notes": null
}
```

### Asset Class Override Table (in `backend/routers/tickers.py`)
Override table is checked FIRST before any yfinance inference. Add new entries here when lookup returns wrong asset class:

```python
ASSET_CLASS_OVERRIDES = {
    # Domestic Fixed Income
    'TLT': 'Domestic Fixed Income', 'LQD': 'Domestic Fixed Income',
    'HYG': 'Domestic Fixed Income', 'CLOX': 'Domestic Fixed Income',
    # International Equities
    'EWG': 'International Equities', 'EWQ': 'International Equities',
    'EWP': 'International Equities', 'KWT': 'International Equities',
    'KWEB': 'International Equities', 'EWJ': 'International Equities',
    'EWW': 'International Equities', 'TUR': 'International Equities',
    'UAE': 'International Equities',
    # Foreign Exchange
    'GLD': 'Foreign Exchange', 'SGOL': 'Foreign Exchange',
    'FXB': 'Foreign Exchange', 'FXE': 'Foreign Exchange', 'FXY': 'Foreign Exchange',
    # Commodities
    'USO': 'Commodities', 'SLV': 'Commodities', 'PALL': 'Commodities',
    'PPLT': 'Commodities', 'CANE': 'Commodities', 'WOOD': 'Commodities',
    'CORN': 'Commodities', 'WEAT': 'Commodities',
    # Digital Assets
    'IBIT': 'Digital Assets',
}
```

### Lookup Rules
1. Override table wins — always checked first
2. Only fills empty form fields — never overwrites existing values
3. Graceful on missing data — `null` fields returned, no error
4. Never writes to DB — suggestions only
5. yfinance inference runs as fallback for unknown tickers

---

## Phase 5 — Infrastructure Decisions (LOCKED)

### Database: Supabase (Postgres)
- Replaces SQLite in production — all existing tables migrated via Alembic
- Two new tables: `schwab_tokens` (encrypted OAuth tokens), `vol_history` (all vol metrics — IV30, HV30/HV90, VRP, skew; renamed from `iv_history`)
- `price_cache` gains `data_source` column: `'schwab'` | `'yahoo'` | `'yahoo_fallback'`
- Direct connection string → Alembic migrations only
- Pooled connection string (Transaction mode, port 6543) → app runtime

### Schwab API: schwab-py library
- `pip install schwab-py` — do not write raw HTTP calls against Schwab API
- Token storage: Fernet-encrypted in `schwab_tokens` table
- Token refresh: proactive background task every 25 minutes (APScheduler)
- Fallback: all Schwab calls fall back to Yahoo Finance on token expiry or API error
- Data source tagged in `price_cache.data_source` — visible in dashboard header

### EOD Scheduler: Updated Flow (Phase 5+)
```
4:00 PM ET — single chained job (prices → IV → signals)
    schwab_fetch_all()       Schwab primary / Yahoo fallback — writes price_cache
    schwab_fetch_iv()        ~65 requests (options-eligible only) — writes vol_history
    calculate_signals()      full pipeline — writes signal_output + signal_history
    scheduler_log            success/failure entry
```
Both REFRESH DATA and CALCULATE SIGNALS go green together by ~4:02 PM.

### IV-Eligible Tickers
All Tier 1 tickers EXCEPT: VIX, $DJI, SPX, NDX — index options have different chain structure.

### Yahoo Finance Role (Phase 5+)
Yahoo Finance is a permanent silent fallback — never removed. Called automatically when:
- Schwab token is expired or missing
- Schwab API returns an error
- Manual REFRESH DATA during development

### REACT_APP_API_URL
Must be environment-variable driven — not hardcoded to localhost:8000.
- Local `.env`: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- Fly.io secret: `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.signal.suttonmc.com`

---

## Signal Engine Math — Phase 3 (ALL DECISIONS LOCKED)

### Hurst Exponent (H)
- **Method: DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)**
- **Lookback windows:**
  - Trade: 63 trading days
  - Trend: 252 trading days
  - Tail / Long Term: 756 trading days
- **Minimum bars required:** same as lookback — return null if insufficient, do not skip ticker
- **D = 2 − H** (Fractal Dimension derived directly from H)

### DFA Algorithm
```python
def dfa(prices, window):
    # 1. Convert prices to log returns
    # 2. Compute cumulative sum (integration)
    # 3. Scales: log-spaced from 10 bars to window//4, ~20 points
    # 4. For each scale n: fit linear trend per segment, compute RMS of residuals F(n)
    # 5. H = slope of log(F(n)) vs log(n) via linear regression
    # Returns H in [0, 1]
    # H > 0.5 = trending, H < 0.5 = mean-reverting, H = 0.5 = random walk
```

### Conviction Score Formula — v2.0 (Additive Four-Component)
```
H completely removed from conviction formula.
H is still calculated and stored for regime classification display only:
  H < 0.45 → mean-reverting regime (use oscillators: RSI, Stochastics)
  H > 0.55 → trending regime (use trend-following: MA, momentum)

conviction_final = structural_score + quad_score + volume_score + vix_score
                 → floor(0) → ×0.92 dampener (target-side hrr/lrr_warn) → ×1.05 NATH boost → cap(105)

Structural (0 / 25 / 50):
  Both aligned (Bullish+Bullish or Bearish+Bearish) → 50
  One direction, one Neutral → 25
  Both Neutral OR opposing (Bullish+Bearish) → 0

Quad (−15 / −11 / 0 / +15 / +20):
  Viewpoint=Neutral → 0 (gate)
  Aligned, prob≥0.45 → +20; Aligned, prob<0.45 → +15
  Neutral alignment → 0
  Misaligned, prob≥0.45 → −15; Misaligned, prob<0.45 → −11

Volume (0 / +10 / +15):
  obv_direction: 40-bar regression on OBV series, normalized by std(OBV[-40:])
  obv_confirming: STRICT — regression dir AND MA20 slope (3-bar ROC) both confirm Trade Dir
  obv_confirming → +10; + obv_slope_trend accelerating in trade dir → +15

  OBV signals:
    obv_slope: sign of 3-bar ROC on OBV MA20: 'rising' | 'falling' | 'flat'
    obv_slope_trend: acceleration: slope_now vs slope_prev: 'increasing' | 'decreasing' | 'flat'

VIX/Vol (0 / +5 / +10 / +15 — Domestic Equities only; all other asset classes receive +15 flat):
  VIX < 19 AND VIX HRR < 19 → +15  (Investable+ — vol firmly locked below threshold)
  VIX < 19 (HRR still elevated) → +10  (Investable)
  VIX 19–23 → +5  (Edgy)
  VIX 24–29 → +0  (Choppy)
  VIX ≥ 30  → +0  (Danger)
  VIX HRR sourced from signal_output where ticker='VIX', timeframe='trade'
  Missing VIX row → +15 (default full credit)

Range: 0–105 (v2.0 additive formula; 105 only when NATH boost fires)
  Base max:  Structural 50 + Quad 20 + Volume 15 + VIX 15 = 100
  NATH max:  100 × 1.05 = 105 (Viewpoint=Bullish AND trade HRR > ATH)
  Floor: 0 (quad misalignment absorbed by floor before dampener)

Alert threshold: conviction >= 80 (v2.0 — requires full structural + aligned quad + some VIX)
Display threshold: conviction >= 45 (blank below); Neutral viewpoint shows in grey #8899aa when >= 45
CRITICAL: Conviction ALWAYS CALCULATES regardless of Viewpoint. Viewpoint = Neutral shows grey, never alerts.

vol_signal (Confirming/Diverging/Neutral) still computed and stored for popup display.
It no longer drives a multiplier — used only for popup Vol Signal display.
```

**Tail/Long Term H (756-day):** calculated and stored, displayed in popup as context only.
Not used in conviction formula.

### Direction Determination — Pivots Only (H has NO role)

**H does not determine direction. H is stored for regime classification display only (v1.8+: H removed from conviction formula and band width).**

```python
# Direction check — pivot engine pre-handles B-based breaks when d_extended; _compute_direction
# receives clean state values and applies C-based check for VALID states.
if structural_state in ("BREAK_CONFIRMED", "NO_STRUCTURE"):
    trade_dir = "Neutral"
elif structural_state in ("BREAK_OF_TRADE", "BREAK_OF_TREND"):
    trade_dir = "Bullish" if pivot_direction == "uptrend" else "Bearish"  # direction HOLDS
elif pivot_direction == "uptrend" and current_price > c:
    trade_dir = "Bullish"
elif pivot_direction == "downtrend" and current_price < c:
    trade_dir = "Bearish"
else:
    trade_dir = "Neutral"

# Viewpoint — three states only
if trade_dir == "Bullish" and trend_dir == "Bullish":
    viewpoint = "Bullish"
elif trade_dir == "Bearish" and trend_dir == "Bearish":
    viewpoint = "Bearish"
else:
    viewpoint = "Neutral"
```

| Condition | Direction |
|---|---|
| Uptrend + price above C | Bullish |
| Downtrend + price below C | Bearish |
| BREAK_OF_TRADE (one close through break level) | **Bullish or Bearish — direction HOLDS** (provisional, first-day forgiveness) |
| BREAK_OF_TREND (one close through break level) | **Bullish or Bearish — direction HOLDS** (provisional, first-day forgiveness) |
| BREAK_CONFIRMED (2+ consecutive closes through break level) | Neutral |
| Pullback from D, price still above C | Bullish (UPTREND_VALID — trend intact; FORMING state eliminated v1.7) |
| Bounce from D, price still below C | Bearish (DOWNTREND_VALID — trend intact; FORMING state eliminated v1.7) |
| d_extended=True: D > B + bc_range — B is break level | Direction = Bullish/Bearish per state (pivot engine handles B-based break machine) |
| Insufficient pivot history | Neutral |
| Everything else | Neutral |

### LRR / HRR Display — Always Show

Trade LRR and HRR always calculate and always display regardless of viewpoint.
Trend Level and Tail Level display only when direction is not Neutral AND slope confirms direction.
Color communicates the state:
- Bullish direction → green
- Bearish direction → red
- Neutral direction → grey (`#8899aa`)
Each LRR/HRR cell uses its own timeframe's direction for color — not the overall viewpoint.

### Viewpoint States — FINAL (LOCKED)

| Viewpoint | Condition | Conviction |
|---|---|---|
| **Bullish** | Trade Bullish + Trend Bullish | Calculated; shown in green when ≥ 45 |
| **Bearish** | Trade Bearish + Trend Bearish | Calculated; shown in red when ≥ 45 |
| **Neutral** | Any other combination — including one Neutral, one Bullish/Bearish, or opposite directions | Calculated; shown in **grey `#8899aa`** when ≥ 45; never alerts |

**No Diverging state.** Three states only: Bullish, Bearish, Neutral.
**Conviction always calculates (v2.0)** — blank (None) only when score < 45. Neutral viewpoint displays score in grey; it does not suppress calculation.

### Alert Flag ⚡ Trigger (v2.0 — TWO conditions)
1. Viewpoint = Bullish OR Bearish (never fires on Neutral)
2. Conviction ≥ 80 (v2.0; requires full structural 50 + quad aligned 20 + partial VIX 10 minimum)

### The Four Trading Scenarios

**Scenario 1 — Bearish Trend + Bearish Trade (Aligned Short)**
- Viewpoint = Bearish
- Add to short: price near or at HRR (entry zone on bounce)
- Remove short: Trade or Trend breaks (price closes above C)

**Scenario 2 — Bearish Trend, Trade Turning**
- Viewpoint = Neutral
- Trade breaks upward: higher low C forms, price closes above B on trade timeframe
- Either continues (→ Scenario 3) or Trade fails and breaks back below new C

**Scenario 3 — Bullish Trend + Bullish Trade (Aligned Long)**
- Viewpoint = Bullish
- Add to long: price near or at LRR
- Lighten long: price approaching HRR
- Remove long: Trade or Trend breaks (price closes below C)

**Scenario 4 — Bullish Trend, Trade Breaking Down**
- Viewpoint = Neutral (Trade broken, Trend still Bullish)
- Trade Dir flips to Neutral immediately on close below C
- LRR/HRR still show — displayed grey
- Watch for Trend break (price closes below Trend C)

### ABC Pivot Structure

**Uptrend:**
```
A = pivot low   (e.g. $100)
B = pivot high  (e.g. $110)  — higher high
C = higher low  (e.g. $105)  — C > A confirms uptrend
D = running high             — established when price closes above B
```

**Downtrend (mirror):**
```
A = pivot high  (e.g. $100)
B = pivot low   (e.g. $90)   — lower low
C = lower high  (e.g. $95)   — C < A confirms downtrend
D = running low              — established when price closes below B
```

**Pivot detection bar windows:**
- Trade: **5 bars** (before AND after — both sides required)
- Trend: **10 bars** (before AND after — both sides required)
- Long Term: **50 bars** (before AND after — both sides required)

**CRITICAL — Pivot confirmation requires bar_window bars on BOTH sides:**
```python
# Pivot high at index i:
prices[i] == max(prices[i - bar_window : i + bar_window + 1])

# Pivot low at index i:
prices[i] == min(prices[i - bar_window : i + bar_window + 1])

# NEVER confirm a pivot without full bar_window on both sides
# This means the most recent bar_window bars can never be confirmed pivots
# D is always a running value — never a confirmed pivot
```

**CRITICAL — Today's EOD bar IS included in price history:**
```python
# yahoo_finance.py stores today's close when fetched after market close
history_closes = closes[closes.index.date <= date.today()]
```
The scheduler runs at 4:00 PM ET after market close, so today's close is a confirmed EOD price —
not an incomplete intraday bar. Including it lets today count as a post-pivot confirmation bar
(e.g. the 5th bar after a pivot fires on the day of data fetch, not the next trading day).

### C Update Logic — CRITICAL

**C is NOT set once and frozen. C updates dynamically as the trend develops.**

```python
# After initial C is confirmed, on every calculation run:

# UPTREND — C walks UP (higher lows)
new_pivot_low = find_most_recent_confirmed_pivot_low(prices, bar_window)
if new_pivot_low > current_C:
    current_C = new_pivot_low  # Update to higher low

# DOWNTREND — C walks DOWN (lower highs)
new_pivot_high = find_most_recent_confirmed_pivot_high(prices, bar_window)
if new_pivot_high < current_C:
    current_C = new_pivot_high  # Update to lower high

# Break of trade always uses CURRENT C — never stale C
if direction == UPTREND and current_price < current_C:
    state = BREAK_OF_TRADE

if direction == DOWNTREND and current_price > current_C:
    state = BREAK_OF_TRADE
```

**Why this matters:** A stale C means LRR is anchored to an old pivot, break levels are wrong,
and conviction is understated. C must always reflect the most recent confirmed higher low
(uptrend) or lower high (downtrend).

**Example — GLD trade timeframe:**
```
Initial C = $427.13  Feb 2    (first confirmed higher low)
Updated C = $448.20  Feb 17   (new higher low — C walks up)
Break of trade = price closes below $448.20 (current C)
NOT $427.13 (stale C)
```

### LRR / HRR — Naming Convention
- **LRR = always the lower price value**
- **HRR = always the higher price value**

**Uptrend:** Enter at LRR, target HRR (above D)
**Downtrend:** Enter at HRR (bounce), target LRR (below D)

### LRR / HRR Formula — Bollinger Band + Snap Framework v1.9.1 (`conviction_engine.py`)

**SUPERSEDES:** v1.8 fixed-N (20) BB + ATR buffer + MA20-regime switch. ATR/MA20-regime no longer drive the trade band; their columns remain on `price_cache` for legacy/inspection purposes only. See full v1.9.1 doc above ("Trade LRR/HRR — v1.9.1 Formula").

**Authoritative spec:** `Docs/SignalMatrix_RR_v1_9_1.txt`. Constants are TOS-validated values, not the spec defaults — see top of `conviction_engine.py` for current values.

#### Daily Overshoot Flag (Tactical — Unrelated to Snap)
```python
# uptrend:   if today_close > prior_hrr → hrr_extended = True  (↑ flag, "do not chase" tooltip)
# downtrend: if today_close < prior_lrr → lrr_extended = True  (↓ flag, "do not chase" tooltip)
# Stored in signal_output.lrr_extended / hrr_extended (Boolean)
# Independent of hrr_snapped/lrr_snapped — different concept.
```

### Structural States

`structural_state` has exactly **six valid values** — nothing else. EXTENDED and WARNING are NOT structural states.

| State | Uptrend Condition | Downtrend Condition | Display | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UPTREND_VALID | C > A, D established, price above C | — | Green | Bullish |
| DOWNTREND_VALID | — | C < A, D established, price below C | Red | Bearish |
| BREAK_OF_TRADE | Price closes below break level (trade tf) | Price closes above break level (trade tf) | **Amber** state cell — direction HOLDS | Bullish / Bearish |
| BREAK_OF_TREND | Price closes below break level (trend tf) | Price closes above break level (trend tf) | **Amber** state cell — direction HOLDS | Bullish / Bearish |
| BREAK_CONFIRMED | 2+ consecutive closes on wrong side of break level | same | **Red** state cell — direction → Neutral | Neutral |
| NO_STRUCTURE | Insufficient pivot history | Insufficient pivot history | Grey — LRR/HRR grey | Neutral |

**Break level = C normally; B when `d_extended = True` (D > B + abs(B-C)).** The break level applies to all state transitions (BREAK_OF_TRADE, BREAK_OF_TREND, BREAK_CONFIRMED) and to all warn flags (⚠ on LRR/HRR cells).

**WARNING is a boolean flag only** — `warning` field in `signal_output`. It fires when LRR drifts below break level (uptrend) or HRR drifts above break level (downtrend). It is communicated via ⚠ on the LRR/HRR cells, NOT by overriding `structural_state`. Break level respects `d_extended` for this check too.

**Critical rules:**
- **Break level = C normally; B when d_extended = True** — applies to BREAK_OF_TRADE, BREAK_CONFIRMED, and warn flags
- **One close through break level = BREAK_OF_TRADE immediately** — direction HOLDS (Bullish/Bearish), state cell → amber; forgiveness: recovery before day 2 restores the prior state
- **2+ consecutive closes through break level = BREAK_CONFIRMED** — direction → Neutral, state cell → red; recovery requires close above B (same as before `d_extended` logic)
- **BREAK_OF_TRADE does NOT change direction** — only BREAK_CONFIRMED does
- **Price recovers above break level after 1-day break** → prior state restored (engine recalculates fresh each run)
- **Price recovers above break level after BREAK_CONFIRMED** → still Neutral until price closes above B
- **Intraday violations irrelevant** — engine uses EOD closes only
- **Break of Trade = reduce to minimum position** — Trend break = go to zero
- **LRR/HRR always show** — color reflects state (green/red/grey); BREAK states show grey LRR/HRR
- **Direction determined by pivots only** — LRR has no role in direction check
- **Trade and Trend states are independent** — Trend break does not auto-flip Trade
- **C updates dynamically** — always references most recent confirmed higher low / lower high

**Staleness thresholds (`pivot_engine.py` — `_STALE_C_DAYS`):**
```
Trade:     C older than  60 trading days → NO_STRUCTURE (structure too old to trade)
Trend:     C older than 120 trading days → NO_STRUCTURE (structure too old for directional bias)
Tail/LT:   No cutoff                     → LT structures are inherently old
```

**ABC transition to bearish after uptrend break:**
```
When uptrend breaks (BREAK_OF_TREND):
  Bearish A = old bullish D             (highest confirmed point — already exists)
  Bearish C = first lower high after D  (lower high — already confirmed, C < A ✅)
  Bearish B = first confirmed lower low (confirms AFTER the break — needs bar_window bars after)
  DOWNTREND_VALID fires as soon as bearish B confirms — bearish C already existed
```
No new downtrend can print until bearish B confirms (bar_window × 2 bars minimum after the break).

## Data Layer

### Rules
- Signal engine NEVER calls yfinance directly — always reads from `price_cache` table
- REFRESH DATA populates the cache — CALCULATE SIGNALS reads from it
- Same-day cache invalidation — stale rows reset before re-fetch
- Price history excludes today's incomplete bar before pivot detection
- Auto-loading from SQLite cache on page load is allowed — it is a local DB read, not a Yahoo call

### Ticker Universe — Source of Truth
- **SQLite `tickers` table** is the source of truth as of Task 4.6
- `tickers.js` is seed data only — runs once on first FastAPI startup if table is empty
- Do not modify `tickers.js` — use the admin panel to add/edit/deactivate tickers
- `get_active_tickers(db)` is the only way backend should retrieve the ticker list — no hardcoded arrays

---

## Methodology Reference

### Timeframes
- **Trade** — ≤ 3 weeks — entry/exit timing; risk level: LRR + HRR (BB framework)
- **Trend** — ≤ 3 months — directional bias filter; risk level: Trend Level (MA100 single floor/ceiling)
- **Tail / Long Term** — ~3 years — macro structural context (display only); risk level: Tail Level (MA200); code/DB key stays "lt"; display label is "Tail"

### Signal Components
1. **Fractal Dimension (D)** — D→1.0 trending, D→1.5 choppy, D→2.0 mean-reverting. D = 2 − H
2. **Hurst Exponent (H)** — H>0.5 trending, H<0.5 mean-reverting, H=0.5 random walk. Method: DFA
3. **Bollinger Band LRR/HRR** — MA20 ± k×STD20; k modulated by H. Replaces Gaussian sigma framework (v1.7)
4. **Relative IV** — IV as percentile of its own 52-week range. Stock-specific, not vs VIX.
   **v1.7 role: informational display in popup only.** NOT in conviction formula. NOT in LRR/HRR formula.
5. **Volume Signal (OBV)** — Confirming / Diverging / Neutral. +10/+15 additive in conviction v2.0 (was multiplier in v1.9).

### Direction Values (ALL three timeframes)
- **Bullish** / **Bearish** / **Neutral** — never Up / Down

## Statistical Framework

| Component | Paradigm | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Hurst Exponent | **Frequentist** | Objective measurement of price series property |
| Fractal Dimension | **Frequentist** | Derived from H: D = 2 − H |
| Bollinger Band LRR/HRR | **Frequentist** | MA20 ± k×STD20; k modulated by H (v1.7) |
| Relative IV Percentile | **Frequentist** | Rank within own 52-week history — informational only (v1.7) |
| Conviction Score | **Frequentist** | Structural + Quad + Volume + VIX additive (v2.0) |
| Trend / Tail Level | **Frequentist** | MA100 / MA200 slope-confirmed floor or ceiling (v1.7) |
| OBV Direction | **Frequentist** | 40-bar linear regression on OBV series, normalized slope |
| Quad Probability Distribution | **Bayesian** | Continuously updated belief across 4 quads |
| Forward Quarter Projections Q2-Q4 | **Bayesian** | Prior decay without new confirming evidence |
| Policy Signal Modifiers | **Bayesian** | Discrete evidence updates to forward projections |

- Close prices: real — auto-loaded from SQLite cache on page load
- Sparklines: real — 60-day price history
- Rel IV: real — Schwab IV Percentile from options chain (`iv_source = 'schwab'`); falls back to Yahoo proxy (`iv_source = 'proxy'`) on token expiry or per-ticker error
- Volume: real — daily volume from Yahoo Finance
- Signal columns: **live** — populated from `/api/signals/stored` on page load; recalculated on CALCULATE SIGNALS
- REFRESH DATA: manual fetch only — forces fresh Yahoo Finance fetch outside scheduler window
- CALCULATE SIGNALS: manual trigger only, reads from price_cache

### VIX Regime Indicator — Dashboard Header
Reads from existing `VIX` row in `price_cache` — no new data fetch needed:
```
VIX < 19   → Green  — INVESTABLE
VIX 19–29  → Amber  — CHOPPY
VIX ≥ 30   → Red    — DANGER
```
The old `● VIX X.XX` text indicator has been superseded by the VIX Gauge (see below). Regime logic unchanged.

### VIX Gauge — Dashboard Header
Horizontal gauge bar positioned between the title and summary counts (BULLISH / BEARISH / ALIGNED / ALERTS / ENTRY).
- **Range:** 9 to 45+ (needle clamped at right edge when VIX > 45; numeric display shows actual value)
- **Zone widths** (based on 36-unit span, 9–45):
  - Green (9–20): 30.6% · Amber (20–30): 27.8% · Red (30–45): 41.6%
- **Needle:** 3px wide, extends 4px above/below bar, colored to match current zone, glow + white inner shadow
- **Scale labels:** 9 · 20 · 30 · 45+ at zone boundaries, 11px, `#8899aa`
- **Needle position formula:** `Math.min(Math.max((vix - 9) / 36, 0), 1) * 100` percent
- Labels: INVESTABLE (green) · CHOPPY (amber) · DANGER (red) shown inline next to numeric VIX value
- **VVIX line** — `VVIX 85.3 · 42nd pct` displayed in grey below scale labels; VVIX close from `realDataMap.get("VVIX").close`, rank from `rel_iv` (252-day price rank stored on VVIX price_cache row); hidden when VVIX close is null. Answers: "is VVIX signaling elevated tail risk today vs. history?"
- **VoV (realized)** — still computed and stored in `price_cache.vov_30d` + `vov_rank` for future use (e.g. VVIX vs realized VoV spread signal); not currently displayed

## Popup Fields (click any row) — Phase 6
**Layout:** popup is `position: fixed, top: 48px, right: 0` — anchored top-right, below the global header. Outer div is a flex column with `maxHeight: calc(100vh - 48px)`. Ticker/price header is `flexShrink: 0` (always visible). ⚡ HIGH CONVICTION ALERT banner (when applicable) is pinned directly below the header, also `flexShrink: 0`. All fields scroll in a single `overflowY: auto` container below the banner. Popup never exceeds viewport height.

## Color Coding
- **`#00e5a0` green** — Bullish direction, high conviction, trending H
- **`#ff4d6d` red** — Bearish direction, mean-reverting H
- **`#8899aa` grey** — Neutral direction/viewpoint (everywhere — not amber)
- **`#f0b429` amber** — ⚡ alerts, conviction bar 50-69%, WARNING state, ⚠ per-cell pivot breach

### LRR/HRR Cell Color Logic (LOCKED)
Each LRR/HRR cell uses its **own timeframe's direction** color, not the overall viewpoint:
- `dirRangeColor(dir, isWarn)` → amber if warn flag is true, otherwise `dirColor(dir)`
- Warn flags are price-based, independent of the IV-driven `warning` structural state

### Warning Flag Scope (LOCKED)
Trade timeframe has full warn flags (LRR + HRR, both C and B checks). Trend has a single Trend Level (MA100) — the warn flag applies to that level vs C. Tail never warns.

Two distinct reference points — break level and target reference — are used depending on `d_extended`:

| Condition | `lrr_warn` reference (break level) | `hrr_warn` reference (target) |
|---|---|---|
| `d_extended=False` | C (uptrend) / B (downtrend) | B (uptrend) / C (downtrend) |
| `d_extended=True` | **B** — break level, unchanged | **D** — extended high/low; "can BB target still reach the peak?" |

Full table by timeframe:

| Timeframe | LRR/Level ⚠ condition | HRR ⚠ condition |
|---|---|---|
| **Trade** | Bullish: `lrr < c` (or `< b` when d_extended) · Bearish: `lrr > b` (or `> d` when d_extended) | Bullish: `hrr < b` (or `< d` when d_extended) · Bearish: `hrr > c` (or `> b` when d_extended) |
| **Trend** | Bullish: `level < c` only (MA100 below C pivot) | Bearish: `level > c` only |
| **Tail** | Never | Never (no HRR column) |

**Why D for target-side warn when d_extended:** B is the break level (invalidation). D is the extended high/low the market has already reached. When `d_extended=True`, `hrr_warn` (uptrend) fires when HRR falls below D — "the BB target can no longer reach the extended peak." Comparing against B instead would be nearly impossible to fire in practice (B is far below D) and is the wrong reference for a momentum signal. `lrr_warn` stays anchored to B (the break level) — correct because it is a proximity-to-invalidation warning, not a target warning.

### Git workflow
```
git add .
git commit -m "brief description"
git checkout -- .   # roll back if needed
```

---

## Admin Panel
- **Route:** `localhost:3000/admin` (redirects to `/admin/tickers`) — hidden, not in main nav or sidebar
- **Access:** Password from `.env` → `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — gate is in `AdminPanel.js` shell
- **Tab nav:** Horizontal tabs below the header — [TICKERS] [QUAD SETUP] — add new tabs by extending `TABS` array in `AdminPanel.js`
- **Sub-routes:** `/admin/tickers` → `TickerList.js` · `/admin/quad` → `QuadSetup.js` · unknown paths redirect to tickers
- **App.js route:** `/admin/*` (wildcard required for nested routing)
- **Sidebar:** Hidden on all `/admin/*` paths via `showSidebar` check in `AppLayout`
- **After changing `.env`:** Must restart Docker container
- **Never hardcode the password in source code**
- **Never hard delete tickers** — use `active: false` via DELETE endpoint
- **Adding a new admin tab:** (1) create the component, (2) add `{ label, path }` to `TABS` in `AdminPanel.js`, (3) add `<Route path="x" element={<X />} />` inside `AdminPanel`'s `<Routes>`

---

## Project Rules — Read Before Making Changes
1. **Never modify the ticker universe without explicit instruction** — use admin panel, not code edits
2. **Never hardcode passwords, API keys, or secrets** — always use `.env`
3. **Never hard delete tickers** — use `active: false`
4. **Direction values are Bullish / Bearish / Neutral** — never Up / Down
5. **HRR = Higher Risk Range** — always the higher price value — do not rename
6. **LRR = Lower Risk Range** — always the lower price value — do not rename
7. **Neutral color is `#8899aa` grey** — amber `#f0b429` is for alerts, conviction 50-69%, BREAK_OF_TRADE/BREAK_OF_TREND state cells, and ⚠ per-cell pivot breach flags
8. **Asset Class values must exactly match:** Domestic Equities | Domestic Fixed Income | Digital Assets | Foreign Exchange | International Equities | Commodities | Indices
9. **Keep components modular** — one component per file
10. **Docker:** changes to `src/` reflect on save — no rebuild needed for frontend
11. **Do not modify** `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, or `package.json` without flagging first
12. **Phase 3 signal calculations are locked** — implement per spec above, no deviations
13. **Flag all [OPEN] items** before implementing — do not assume defaults
14. **Commit to Git** after every confirmed working state
15. **Neo = Claude Code** (VS Code extension) — all code changes go here
16. **No worktrees or feature branches** — all changes committed directly to master
17. **Never auto-fetch from Yahoo Finance or Schwab** — REFRESH DATA button only (`/api/market-data/batch`); page load uses `/api/market-data/cached` which is a pure DB read and never calls external APIs. `fetchCachedMarketData()` for page load, `fetchBatchMarketData()` for REFRESH DATA — never swap these.
18. **Never auto-calculate signals** — CALCULATE SIGNALS button only
19. **`backend/signal_matrix.db` must never be committed to Git**
20. **C is the invalidation level** — Break of Trade/Trend fires on price closing through C
21. **Signal engine never calls yfinance directly** — always reads from price_cache table
22. **Pivot confirmation requires bar_window bars on BOTH sides** — before AND after
23. **Today's EOD bar IS included** in price history (`<= date.today()`) — the scheduler fetches after market close so today's close is a confirmed EOD price; excluding it delays pivot confirmation by one trading day
24. **C updates dynamically** — never stale, always most recent confirmed higher low / lower high
25. **Conviction always calculates (v2.0)** — displayed when score ≥ 45 regardless of Viewpoint. Neutral viewpoint shows conviction in grey (`#8899aa`); Bullish/Bearish shows in green/red. Blank only when score < 45. Alert still requires non-Neutral viewpoint AND conviction ≥ 80.
26. **Direction determined by pivots only** — H has no role in direction or viewpoint
27. **LRR/HRR always show** — grey when Neutral, green when Bullish, red when Bearish
28. **Viewpoint has three states only** — Bullish, Bearish, Neutral (no Diverging)
29. **Direction check uses C normally; B when d_extended=True** — `price > c` for Bullish, `price < c` for Bearish; LRR is not part of the direction check. When `d_extended=True`, pivot engine pre-handles B-based breaks before `_compute_direction` is called — no EXTENDED case needed in direction logic.
30. **LRR/HRR always compute for BREAK states** — `_infer_pivot_direction` infers underlying direction even for BREAK_OF_TRADE/BREAK_OF_TREND/BREAK_CONFIRMED so LRR/HRR render grey
31. **LRR/HRR cell color = timeframe direction** — use `dirRangeColor(dir, isWarn)`, NOT viewpoint color
32. **Per-cell ⚠ warn flags are price-based** — separate from IV-driven `warning` structural state
33. **Warning scope is timeframe-specific** — Trade: full (C+B, or B+D when d_extended); Trend: C-based only; LT: none. When `d_extended=True`, `lrr_warn` stays anchored to B (break level); `hrr_warn` (uptrend) / `lrr_warn` (downtrend) target-side compares against D (the extended high/low), not B.
34. **All cache_date and run_date writes use ET date** — never UTC date for trading day keys
35. **`get_active_tickers(db)`** is the only way to retrieve the ticker list in backend — no hardcoded arrays
36. **tickers.js is seed data only** — never import it for the live ticker universe; use `/api/tickers`
37. **Asset class overrides checked first** — add new entries to `ASSET_CLASS_OVERRIDES` in `tickers.py` when yfinance returns wrong asset class
38. **Neo cannot read .docx files** — CLAUDE.md is the primary spec source for Neo; keep it current
39. **One close through break level = BREAK_OF_TRADE immediately** — break level = C normally; B when `d_extended=True`. Direction HOLDS during BREAK_OF_TRADE (not Neutral). Forgiveness: recovery on day 1 restores prior state; 2+ consecutive closes = BREAK_CONFIRMED → direction → Neutral. Recovery from BREAK_CONFIRMED: close above B (non-extended); close at or above D when `d_extended=True` (B is too close to oscillation noise — only re-establishing D proves the extension can be reclaimed). Implemented in `compute_d_and_state`: early-return `UPTREND_VALID` when `current_price >= d_price`; `_check_break_confirmed` receives `d_price` as recovery threshold instead of `b_price` in d_extended branches.
40. **Break of Trade = reduce to minimum position** — Trend break = go to zero (full exit)
41. **OBV direction uses 40-bar linear regression (v2.0)** — `_obv_direction()` computes a 40-bar linear regression slope on the OBV series, normalized by `std(OBV[-40:])` to be scale-invariant across tickers. `|normalized slope| ≤ 0.02` (_OBV_NEUTRAL_BAND) → Neutral; > 0.02 → Bullish; < -0.02 → Bearish. Replaces the prior ABCD pivot engine on OBV. `obv_confirming` is strict: regression direction AND OBV MA20 3-bar ROC slope must both confirm Trade Dir.
42. **Schwab API approved for Phase 5** — OBV volume source swap point flagged with `# PHASE 5 TODO` in `yahoo_finance.py`; OBV engine in `conviction_engine.py` is source-agnostic
43. **schwab-py is the only Schwab API client** — never write raw HTTP calls against Schwab endpoints
44. **Yahoo Finance is a permanent fallback** — never remove it; always called when Schwab is unavailable
45. **Token encryption is mandatory** — Schwab tokens must be Fernet-encrypted before writing to DB
46. **REACT_APP_API_URL must be env-variable driven** — never hardcode localhost:8000 in production code
47. **auto_stop_machines = false on API app** — Fly.io must not stop the API container or scheduler won't fire
48. **Alembic manages all schema changes** — never modify Supabase tables directly via dashboard
49. **IV-eligible tickers exclude VIX, $DJI, SPX, NDX** — index options chains have different structure
50. **data_source column must be written on every price_cache upsert** — 'schwab', 'yahoo', or 'yahoo_fallback'
51. **`ma20_regime` is no longer computed (v1.9.1)** — was a v1.7/v1.8 concept used by the old ATR-buffer trade RR formula to switch between tight and wide entry-side bands. v1.9.1 replaced that with snap state. The `price_cache.ma20_regime` column still exists in the schema but is never written or read. Don't reintroduce it without a redesign.
52. **LT timeframe code/DB key stays `"lt"` everywhere** — display label only changes to "Tail" (UI, popup headers, table header). Never rename in models, DB columns, or backend API responses.
53. **Three independent "extended" concepts — never conflate:**
    - `d_extended` (Boolean field) — D > B + abs(B-C); B becomes break level; drives warn flags and popup `*`; NOT in structural_state
    - `lrr_extended` / `hrr_extended` (Boolean fields) — daily overshoot: today's close vs prior LRR/HRR; drives ↑↓ flags on LRR/HRR cells
    - "EXTENDED" string — **no longer exists** in structural_state or anywhere in the system
54. **Trend Level and Tail Level display `None` when direction is Neutral** — no level shown; also hidden when MA slope contradicts Trend/Tail direction
55. **ENTRY prox threshold = 0.85** — do not revert to 2%-of-price absolute threshold; prox is range-normalized via HRR-LRR (STD20-derived, automatically volatility-scaled)
56. **Proximity removed from conviction formula (v2.0)** — proximity belongs to the alert/intraday system (PROXIMITY alert in intraday monitor) and the ENTRY signal column. It is no longer a conviction component. Conviction v2.0 uses Structural + Quad + Volume + VIX additive scoring only.
57. **`structural_state` has exactly six valid values** — `UPTREND_VALID`, `DOWNTREND_VALID`, `BREAK_OF_TRADE`, `BREAK_OF_TREND`, `BREAK_CONFIRMED`, `NO_STRUCTURE`. Never add EXTENDED, WARNING, or any other value.
58. **BREAK_OF_TRADE / BREAK_OF_TREND do NOT change direction to Neutral** — direction holds (Bullish/Bearish) during provisional break; only BREAK_CONFIRMED flips direction to Neutral
59. **WARNING is a boolean flag only** — `signal_output.warning`; never override `structural_state` to "WARNING" in `conviction_engine.py`
60. **`d_extended` is the sole source of truth for B vs C break level** — `is_warning`, `_compute_warn_flags`, popup `tradeBreakIsB`/`trendBreakIsB`, and `warnTip` all read `d_extended` directly; never derive from state string comparison
61. **VIX score tiers (v2.1)** — Investable+ (VIX < 19 AND VIX HRR < 19) +15 · Investable (VIX < 19) +10 · Edgy (19–23) +5 · Choppy (24–29) +0 · Danger (≥ 30) +0. VIX HRR read from `signal_output` (ticker='VIX', timeframe='trade'). **Applies to Domestic Equities only** — all other asset classes receive +15. `get_vix_score(vix_close, asset_class, vix_hrr)`. **NATH Boost (×1.05):** Viewpoint=Bullish AND trade HRR > `price_cache.ath` → multiply conviction_sum by 1.05 after dampener, before cap. Do not change without explicit instruction.
66. **Quad score is probability-weighted (v2.0)** — `alignment = get_quad_alignment(asset_class, sector, current_quad)` → +1.0/0.0/-1.0. Viewpoint=Neutral → quad_score=0. Aligned: +20 (prob≥0.45) or +15 (prob<0.45). Misaligned: -15 (prob≥0.45) or -11 (prob<0.45). Neutral alignment: 0. `quad_score` (Integer) is stored in `signal_output` and shown in popup (green/red/grey). `quad_mult` still written to `signal_output` for debug only — not in v2.0 formula and not shown in popup. Index sectors always return 0.
67. **Quad settings use upsert semantics** — POST to `/api/quad/settings` checks `UNIQUE(country, forecast_month, quad_type)`: updates existing row if found, inserts new row otherwise. `forecast_month` replaces the old `effective_date` key. Conviction reads the US monthly row whose `forecast_month` = current ET month (not most-recent-row). Admin Panel → QUAD SETUP manages this.
68. **Quad alignment uses sector-first priority** — `get_quad_alignment()` checks `sector` key first, then `asset_class`. This correctly handles USD (sector="USD"), GLD/SGOL//GC (sector="Gold"), JPY/FXY (sector="Yen"), FXB (sector="British Pound"), FXE (sector="Euro"), IBIT (sector="Cryptocurrency"). Foreign Exchange asset_class is the fallback for any unlisted FX ticker.
71. **International Equities route to country quarterly quads** — `signals.py` `run_output()` routes tickers with `asset_class = "International Equities"` to their country's current-quarter quad (e.g. EWJ sector="Japan" → "JP" → `YYYY-QN` quarterly row) instead of the US monthly quad. `_SECTOR_TO_CODE` dict in `signals.py` maps sector labels to ISO country codes. If no country quarterly quad is set, falls back to no quad (multiplier = 1.00). Dashboard columns for international rows show the country quarterly quad (no probability — quarterly rows always store 1.0); US monthly quad + probability shown for all other rows. Quarterly data fetched in `App.js` from `/api/quad/settings?country=ALL&type=quarterly` on page load, mapped via `CODE_TO_SECTOR` to build `countryQuads` state `{sector: {cur, next}}`.
72. **Quad UI colors (dashboard + QuadSetup)** — Q1: `#007a55` (dark green, white text) · Q2: `#00e5a0` (system green) · Q3: `#f0b429` (system amber) · Q4: `#ff4d6d` (system red). Box style: `background: color + "55"` (33% opacity) + `border: 1px solid color` + white text — matches QuadBtn active style. Do not introduce new quad color values.
73. **Conviction tooltip — 2-line format (v2.0)** — Line 1: formula `Structural (50) + Quad (±20) + Volume (15) + VIX (15) → floor(0) → dampener → NATH boost → cap(105)`. Line 2: display rules `Show ≥ 45 · Green/Red ≥ 45 (Bullish/Bearish) · Grey ≥ 45 (Neutral) · ⚡ ≥ 80`. Do not revert to proximity/multiplier descriptions.
69. **Slope boost changed to × 1.20 in v1.9** (was × 1.17 in v1.8). Do not revert to 1.17.
62. **H_eff (asymmetric Hurst) asset class scope (Phase 6)** — asymmetric H (H_trend_up / H_trend_down) applies to Commodities and Foreign Exchange ONLY. All other asset classes use symmetric H_trend. `/ZN` (10-Year Treasury futures) is EXCLUDED from asymmetric H despite being a futures ticker — its price series is driven by rate policy, not directional commodity flows; always uses symmetric H_trend.
63. **ΔH (delta-H) threshold for display color** — `h_trade_delta >= 0` → green (momentum improving or stable); `h_trade_delta < -0.05` → red (meaningful deterioration); between -0.05 and 0 → neutral grey. Stored in `signal_output.h_trade_delta`; display only — NOT in conviction formula.
64. **VoV rank computed from existing VIX price history** — no separate accumulation period needed. `compute_vov_with_rank()` computes 30-day rolling std of VIX log returns (VoV series) from 5-year history in `price_cache`, then ranks current VoV within its own 252-day trailing window. Returns `(vov_30d, vov_rank)` tuple. Stored in `price_cache.vov_30d` and `price_cache.vov_rank`. Updated on every REFRESH DATA when VIX history is fetched. Not currently displayed — retained for future VVIX vs realized VoV spread signal.
**VVIX price rank** — computed in `refresh_data()` in `market_data.py` after VoV. Ranks VVIX close within its own 252-day price history (0–100). Stored in `price_cache.rel_iv` for the VVIX row (VVIX has no options chain so rel_iv is otherwise unused). `iv_source` set to `"price_rank"`. Displayed in VIX gauge header as `VVIX 85.3 · 42nd pct`. Popup shows `IV Rank — price_rank`. Do not replace with the Yahoo realized-vol proxy — price rank answers the correct question (is VVIX elevated vs history?).
65. **Proactive spec review** — when reading a spec or reviewing methodology, flag any inconsistencies with existing code or other parts of the spec before implementing. Do not implement silently when something looks wrong or contradictory.
70. **UI text contrast — 3-level hierarchy** — Never use `#445566` or darker for readable text. Three levels: (1) `#00e5a0` green for section titles/headers; (2) `#c8d8e8` for column headers, data labels, group separators; (3) `#8899aa` for descriptive/secondary text (subtitles, inactive controls, units). Reserve `#445566` and darker for decorative borders only.
74. **Intraday monitor uses `schwab_fetch_intraday_quotes` — never `schwab_fetch_all`** — `schwab_fetch_all()` has an idempotency check that freezes `price_cache.close` after the first same-day call. `schwab_fetch_intraday_quotes()` always calls `get_quotes()`, uses `lastPrice` only, and does not update `cache_date`. Swapping them silently breaks the 15-minute price refresh.
75. **Never call `calculate_signals()` intraday** — pivot states require confirmed EOD closes; running signals intraday produces false BREAK_OF_TRADE states. The intraday monitor is purely observational.
76. **Intraday scheduler uses `CronTrigger` — never `"interval"`** — `CronTrigger(day_of_week="mon-fri", hour="9-15", minute="0,15,30,45", timezone="America/New_York")` aligns to clock boundaries, guaranteeing the first fire is exactly 9:30 AM ET. An interval trigger fires relative to container start time and will miss the open if the container starts at an off-minute.
77. **Trade RR uses v1.9.2 BB+Snap formula with directional proximity** — see "Trade LRR/HRR — v1.9.1 Formula" section (computation steps updated to v1.9.2). Constants: TOS-validated (`k_extend=2.2, k_max=1.0, k_min=0.0, k_wide=2.0, k_decay=0.5` — code in `conviction_engine.py` is source of truth; see ADR-013). Vol source: IV-primary (`vol_history.implied_vol`) with HV30 fallback. σ price-derived. Snap trigger: **closes** vs prior 22 closes (unchanged). **Directional proximity**: `prox_lrr = (close − maN) / sdN` (signed); when price falls below maN, prox goes negative, k_lrr_dyn expands toward k_wide, pulling snap line down to BB — eliminates LRR inversion during price pullback below MA. **Snap releases via merge** (k_dyn reaches k_wide, gradual) **or breach** (price crosses the compressed snap line, fast/sharp moves). Snap state persists in `signal_output.hrr_snapped/lrr_snapped`.
78. **`compute_trade_lrr_hrr` is pure** — receives `(closes, vol_series, prior_hrr_snapped, prior_lrr_snapped)` and returns `(lrr, hrr, hrr_snapped, lrr_snapped)`. No DB access in the math function. The caller (`compute_output`) handles vol source lookup (`get_trade_rr_vol_series`) and snap state I/O. Cold-start floor: `len(closes) >= 273` (252 rank window + 21 prior bars for oldest HV computation in fallback path).
79. **ATR + MA20 regime are out of the trade RR path (v1.9.1)** — `compute_trade_lrr_hrr` reads `closes` + `vol_series` only. The columns split into two groups:
    - **Still updated daily:** `price_cache.ma20`, `ma50`, `ma100`, `ma200`, `std20` — written on every fetch (cheap; useful for popup display, MA200 for Tail Level, future signals).
    - **Frozen (no longer written):** `price_cache.atr`, `price_cache.ma20_regime` — the writers and computation functions were deleted in the post-v1.9.1 cleanup. Existing rows keep their last-fetched values; new fetches don't touch these columns. Schema kept (no migration needed).
    - Don't re-add ATR or MA20 regime to the trade-tf branch in `compute_output` without a redesign of the v1.9.1 framework.
80. **Cookie config: `secure=IS_PRODUCTION`, `samesite="lax"`** — never hardcode `secure=True` (breaks local dev cookies on `http://localhost:3000`) or `samesite="strict"` (breaks password reset email link clickthroughs). `IS_PRODUCTION` is `os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production"`.
81. **Live DB role check in admin endpoints** — `require_admin_user(request, db)` (in `services/auth_service.py`) re-fetches the user from DB and checks `user.role == "admin"`. Never trust the JWT role payload directly (it can be stale up to 12h after a demotion). Use this dependency on every admin-only endpoint (`/api/users/*`, `/api/signals/calculate`, `/api/market-data/batch`).
82. **`/api/auth/check`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout` use raw `fetch` in `AuthContext.js`** — never `apiFetch`. `/check` returns 200 with `{authenticated: false}` when not logged in (never 401), so the apiFetch 401-redirect path could otherwise loop. Auth pages (`/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) also use raw fetch since the user isn't authenticated yet.
83. **No approval email to new users** — admin manually activates users via `/admin/users` and notifies them out of band. Do not add an automatic approval email without explicit instruction.
84. **Recovery: Supabase direct edit is the documented Path 1** — see `Docs/RUNBOOK_AUTH_RECOVERY.md`. Path 2 is the `python -m scripts.reset_admin` recovery script via `fly ssh console`. Path 3 is nuke-and-reseed (last resort).
85. **Logout is cookie-clear only — JWT remains valid until natural expiry (12h max)** — `POST /api/auth/logout` deletes the cookie client-side. The JWT itself is not blocklisted. For true session revocation (e.g., compromised account), set `users.status = "disabled"` in admin — the middleware checks status on every request and rejects disabled users immediately. See "Deferred decisions" in `Docs/Auth_User_Management_Spec_v1.0.md`.
86. **`apiFetch` is a static function, not a hook** — hard navigation on 401 (`window.location.href = "/login"`) is intentional. Do not refactor to a `useApiFetch` hook. See "Deferred decisions" in `Docs/Auth_User_Management_Spec_v1.0.md`.
87. **Email links in `email_alert.py` use `APP_BASE_URL` env var** — defaults to `https://signal.suttonmc.com` if unset. Local `.env` overrides to `http://localhost:3000` so reset/registration emails clickthrough to local during dev. Never hardcode the production URL.
88. **JWT_SECRET MUST differ between local dev and production** — local in `.env`, production in Fly.io secrets. Never reuse. Rotating JWT_SECRET invalidates every existing session cookie (forces re-login) but does not affect user accounts.
89. **Local Docker connects to PRODUCTION Supabase** — `SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` in `.env` points at the same DB as production. There is no separate local DB. Therefore: every local backend test/registration writes to production. When iterating on auth or any DB-touching feature, expect test users to appear in production. Clean up test fixtures before and after.
90. **Idempotent migrations for new tables** — `Base.metadata.create_all()` runs at startup and creates any new tables from SQLAlchemy models, BEFORE alembic gets a chance to run on a fresh deploy. New `op.create_table` migrations must guard with `if "table_name" not in inspector.get_table_names(): ...` (see `add_users_table.py` / `add_password_reset_tokens_table.py` for the pattern). Otherwise `alembic upgrade head` after deploy fails with "table already exists".
91. **`REFRESH DATA` and `CALCULATE SIGNALS` are admin-only** — both UI buttons (gated by `isAdmin` in App.js) and backend endpoints (`/api/market-data/batch`, `/api/signals/calculate` use `require_admin_user`). Viewers see cached data via `/api/market-data/cached` and `/api/signals/stored`; they cannot trigger expensive recalcs.

## Session-Start Checklist — Run at the Start of Every Backend Session

Neo must run these steps at the start of any session that touches backend code, signals, or schema.
Do not skip. Do not assume the environment is already in sync.

```
1. Confirm Docker is running
   docker ps | grep signal-matrix

2. Sync local SQLite schema with production
   docker exec signal-matrix-backend-1 alembic upgrade head
   (uses local SQLite — keeps dev schema in sync with Alembic migrations)

3. Confirm Fly.io auth is valid (only needed before deploys)
   fly auth whoami

4. Confirm production API is alive (only needed before deploys)
   curl https://api.signal.suttonmc.com/health
```

If step 2 fails, stop and diagnose before making any code changes. A schema mismatch between
local SQLite and the Alembic migration history means local test results are unreliable.

---

## Pre-Migration Checklist — Run Before Every Alembic Migration

Every schema change must follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip steps, do not reorder.

### Step 1 — Write and review the migration file
- Generate: `docker exec signal-matrix-backend-1 alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
- Review the generated file in `backend/alembic/versions/` before running it
- Confirm upgrade() and downgrade() are correct
- Confirm no unexpected table drops or column renames

### Step 2 — Test migration against local SQLite first
```bash
docker exec signal-matrix-backend-1 alembic upgrade head
```
- If this fails, fix the migration file before touching production
- Local SQLite: `alembic/env.py` falls back to `sqlite:////app/signal_matrix.db` when no DB env vars are set

### Step 3 — Encode the Supabase password before production migration
The Supabase password contains `#`, `$`, `/`, and `@` — these are silently mangled by Fly.io
secret storage and break URL parsing if passed raw.

Use the pre-encoded `DATABASE_URL` secret (already set in Fly.io) which has the password
percent-encoded. Confirm it is set:
```bash
fly secrets list --app signal-matrix-api | grep DATABASE_URL
```

The encoded form is: `k%2C%2F2%23RY%40Jma%248rw`
Never pass the raw password in any connection string that goes through Fly.io secret storage.

### Step 4 — Run migration against production (Supabase via pooled connection)
```bash
# SSH into the running Fly.io API container
fly ssh console --app signal-matrix-api

# Inside the container — use pooled connection string (IPv4, port 6543)
# DATABASE_URL env var is already set and pre-encoded
alembic upgrade head

exit
```

Do NOT use the direct connection string (port 5432) from inside Docker on Windows —
it resolves to IPv6 only and Docker Desktop cannot route IPv6 egress.

### Step 5 — Verify migration applied
```bash
fly ssh console --app signal-matrix-api
alembic current   # should show the new revision head
exit
```

Check the Supabase dashboard to confirm new columns/tables are present.

### Step 6 — Redeploy both apps
```bash
fly deploy --app signal-matrix-api
./deploy-web.sh                    # sources .env, passes REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD as build arg
```

Deploy API first, web second. Confirm both are healthy after deploy:
```bash
fly status --app signal-matrix-api
fly status --app signal-matrix-web
curl https://api.signal.suttonmc.com/health
```

### Step 7 — Smoke test
- Open https://signal.suttonmc.com
- Confirm dashboard loads, signals render, no console errors
- If schema added new columns: run CALCULATE SIGNALS once to populate them

### Step 8 — Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "migration: <description>"
```
Only commit after production is confirmed healthy.

## Phase 5 — Planned Features

### Phase 5 — Volume Surge Indicator (deferred from Phase 4)
- OBV pivot engine now live in `conviction_engine.py` — replaces price-momentum proxy
- Phase 5 upgrade: swap Yahoo Finance `volume_history_json` for Schwab streaming volume history
- Swap point flagged with `# PHASE 5 TODO` comment in `yahoo_finance.py`
- OBV engine is source-agnostic — reads from `volume_history_json` regardless of origin
- Volume signal tiers (Phase 5 upgrade — Schwab real-time):
  - Confirming:  today's volume > 20-day avg (any elevated volume)
  - Surge:       today's volume > 150% of 20-day avg (exceptional participation)
  - Neutral:     today's volume within normal range
  - Diverging:   price moving on declining volume
- Dashboard display: icon on conviction cell
  - ▲ green = Confirming
  - ▲▲ green = Surge (150%+)
  - ▼ amber = Diverging
  - no icon = Neutral
- 20-day avg volume already available from Schwab streaming feed

---

## What Is NOT In Scope Yet
- Account positions display (deferred — manage in ThinkorSwim; Phase 6 or later)
- WebSocket streaming (deferred — REST polling is sufficient for EOD signals)
- Volume surge icon on dashboard rows (deferred — opening bar always spikes; daily avg comparison unreliable intraday)
- Schwab order execution (permanently out of scope)
- Quad Tracker dashboard (Phase QT)
- Quad alignment column in Signal Matrix table (Phase QT)
- Tier 2 auto-surfacing based on conviction threshold
- MA20/50/100 display in dashboard UI
- Signal history UI (table exists, endpoint exists — frontend consumption is future scope)
- Intraday alert log UI — `intraday_alert_log` table exists; no dashboard view yet (future scope)

## Ticker Universe — Seed Data (tickers.js — DO NOT USE AS LIVE SOURCE)
